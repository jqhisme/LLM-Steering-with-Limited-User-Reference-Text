{"text": "I imagine hell be gone by the end of the 2nd.  In 2013, according to fantasypros, his average draft position in standard leagues was 22, in ppr it was 16.  He had a great year and his adp will probably be higher this year.  He is one of the few players whose talent isnt relative to his position (like how Calvin Johnson is a top 5 pick and is typically the only receiver in a sea of first round running backs) \n That being said, if you miss out on Graham, the TE position still has Gronkowski, Reed, Cameron (depending on CLEs QB situation), Julius Thomas, Witten, etc.  There is depth there. \n So to answer your question: Yes, you can still find good value past the first two rounds at TE. \n edit: Im temporarily deleting my advice to crunch some TE numbers.  Be back shortly. \n edit2: Lets break this down \n According to the current 2014 rankings (very early I know) on fantasypros.com, Jimmy Graham is rated as the 8th ranked player in standard leagues, 4th(!) ranked player in PPR.  The next TE is Gronkowski. In standard Gronk is ranked 40th and in PPR he is ranked 36th.  In a 10 man league, there is a 3 round difference between the two players.  In standard Julius Thomas is ranked 3rd (45), but in PPR he jumps ahead of Gronk at 31.  Still almost 3 rounds behind Graham. The 4th Ranked TE is Vernon Davis at 52 in standard and 41 in PPR. \n Here are the 2013 stats for those 4 players: \n \n \n Player \n GP \n Rec \n Yards \n Tds \n Avg Rec \n Avg Yds \n Avg TDs \n \n \n \n \n Graham \n 16 \n 86 \n 1215 \n 16 \n 5.4 \n 74.9 \n 1.0 \n \n \n Gronk \n 7 \n 39 \n 592 \n 4 \n 5.6 \n 84.6 \n 0.6 \n \n \n Julius \n 14 \n 65 \n 788 \n 12 \n 4.6 \n 56.3 \n 0.9  \n \n \n Davis \n 15 \n 52 \n 850 \n 13 \n 3.5 \n 56.7 \n 0.9 \n \n \n \n Is Graham worth a first or second round pick? \n Obviously, Graham is the top TE in the NFL.  Last season in standard scoring, he scored 56.5 points more than 2nd place Vernon Davis and 66.7 points more than Julius Thomas. In 16 weeks, thats 3.5 and  4.1 points a week difference respectively. \n Like I said though, Grahams numbers and talent transcend his position.  Last season in standard he was the 25th highest scoring player, 9th in standard if you remove QBs from the equation because of the depth at the QB position. \n He might not reproduce those numbers in 2014, but he will probably still be a top 20 scorer.  Hes not going to make it to the third round in most leagues this year and no one should be mocked or feel like theyve made a bad call in taking him in the first or second round. \n Should you be worried if you miss out on him/how steep is the drop off? \n Graham had a monster year, and is a Tier 1 TE.  Some would put him in a world of his own.  But lets compare his per game averages to Gronks over the last 3 years: \n \n \n Player \n GP \n Avg Rec \n Avg Yds \n Avg TD \n \n \n \n \n Graham \n 47 \n 5.7 \n 74.6 \n 0.8 \n \n \n Gronk \n 34 \n 5.4 \n 79.7 \n 0.9 \n \n \n \n So FantasyPros has Graham ranked as 8th (4 in PPR) and Gronk as 40th (36th in PPR.) The FF experts believe there is a 3 round gap between #1 and #2 when theyve had nearly identical per game averages over the last three years. I guess the question lies mainly with Gronks health but being able to get a top WR or RB in the first round AND get a top TE in the 4th is very tempting. \n I would lump Julius, Davis, Witten, and Cameron on to Tier 2 with Julius being a borderline Tier 1 TE with the question marks being his limited experience and the sheer number of passing targets in Denver.  These guys will all be there in the 4th and 5th round. \n Once you get past these guys, there is a big drop off to the tier that includes Pitta, Olsen, Reed, Rudolph, and Martellus Bennett.  These guys should all be there in rounds 7, 8, or 9. \n Conclusions/", "features": ["names of individuals", "phrases related to sports events and team news", "phrases related to legal matters and sports injuries", "phrases related to restaurants and food chains", "information related to the German language", "phrases related to direction and movement", "percentages and numbers related to statistics and data", "phrases related to conflicts, injustices, and tragedies", "news articles related to various topics like government, legislation, sports, and health"], "feature_ids": [2, 109, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26], "scores": [0.83, 0.92, 0.17, 0.03, 0.01, 0.04, 0.85, 0.23, 0.88]}

{"text": "sighs \n Basically, in the late Sixteenth and early Seventeenth Centuries, a series of wars devastated Ulster, and forced the old Gaelic Lords to leave. A lot of land was then ceded to the English Crown, who settled it with Protestants, largely from Scotland, who would then be more loyal to the English regime. These new Ulster-Scots planters had a different religion and language to the natives, and were often settled in newly-built towns to themselves. This community gradually grew itself, establishing its own churches and other organisations, such as The Orange Order, which commemorated the victory of William of Orange at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. It was these institutions, as well as the vital trading links that existed between Belfast and other parts of Ulster to Scotland and England, which made the Protestant Ulster-Scots community a distinct and cohesive group. When nationalism increased in the 19th and early 20th Century, and the movement for an independent Irish state grew stronger, it was this protestant community, who felt no connection to irish or gaelic culture, who pressured the British into dividing Ireland. They did this by rallying politically and by displaying their loyalty to important symbols such as the British flag, monarchy and national anthem. As The Troubles started in the late 1960s, those traditional religious and cultural views only became more entrenched. The recent problems outlined in the Ross Kemp documentary have been caused by the most hardline Loyalists feeling like their identity and culture is under threat, despite evidence to the contrary. \n ", "features": ["information related to historical figures and events", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "information related to specific topics and points in a text", "mentions of the color red", "phrases related to international relations or policies", "locations or geographic regions", "terms related to law enforcement and legal actions", "information related to governmental policies and international affairs", "phrases related to conflicts, injustices, and tragedies"], "feature_ids": [12, 14, 53, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 25], "scores": [0.98, 0.22, 0.92, 0.01, 0.81, 0.95, 0.05, 0.89, 0.99]}

{"text": "Yes and no. As far as I can tell, the nociceptors are the same that we find in humans, but your knife analogy doesnt hold up. The thing thats hard for us to realize is that, even though we feel the pain at the location of the receptor, the pain is actually created in our brain. And fish dont have the part of the brain that creates the pain. Think of it like sensors. You can have sensors that work and provide points of information to a computer, but if the computer isnt capable of taking that point of information and calculating it (with other points) into a larger picture, then the picture doesnt exist. Or another way: many insects have photoreceptor cells. They may even have areas where the photoreceptor cells are very dense. But if they dont have a part of the brain devoted to coordinating the receptors, they dont see in the way that we (or bees or octupi) see. They get information about light, but sight doesnt exist. \n Surprisingly, our feeling of pain is a lot more subjective than objective. I mentioned the brain disorders because in a lot of these instances, the nociceptors seem to be working. Its the transmittal of the signal that is a problem. So people arent feeling pain - not because the receptor doesnt work - but because the brain isnt processing the feeling of pain. \n I say all of that, then Im going to turn around and speak for the other side of the argument. We are able to see behavioral changes in fish (and insects) in response to noxious stimuli. If weve established that pain is something subjective in us, then its incredibly arrogant to assume that there isnt an analogue. Insects are pretty amazing in their ability to do so many different things with so few neurons. For fish: we see a behavioral response, we see the receptors. Just because the neocortex is missing doesnt mean there isnt a pathway we havent discovered yet. I dont know. I know very little about fish brains, but insect brains have some pretty fantastic ways of processing information that are very different from mammalian brains. So, personally, I only feel comfortable describing what we observe. What we observe is that fish do not process sensory information we call pain in the same way as mammals. And thats as far as I, personally, am willing to go. I dont think we have an answer for whether or not they feel pain. I found an article this morning that demonstrates that application of morphine attenuates their behavior towards noxious stimuli. This is fairly interesting evidence toward nociception at the very least, and possibly what we would call pain reception. \n ", "features": ["phrases related to scientific research and organizations", "phrases related to medical procedures and healthcare policies"], "feature_ids": [484, 708], "scores": [0.98, 0.82]}

The way PSG tried to play against Chelsea seemed a bit strange tactically. \n Cavani is not our man and that is obvious, even though he is a natural goal scorer and brought a lot of goals this season his technical ability is lacking both in dribbling and passing which is very clear when hes under pressure by opposition defense. \n What we really ought to do is to buy a new top class winger, Lucas is amazing at times but he really needs to get his mind straight. Some games he even misses the simplest of passes and too often goes on his own, when it works it looks brilliant but I havent seen lots of Lucas runs to actually turn into goals (if any) but hes still young so hell probably improve.

Winning is important to them, but marketability is much more consistent and profitable, and therefore it is their top priority. (Youre wrong about one thing though- Blevdog is VERY focused on winning; he tends to take losses personally for some reason and stresses out about it for long periods of time before and after a tournament. He genuinely wants to see his teams succeed.) \n If you want MY opinion, I dont personally agree with Curses gameplan; its not stable, its not sustainable at this point, and it just doesnt make sense to have four teams in one scene. Three was pushing it. Four is just ridiculous. They should focus on making their two top teams (LV and Fire/NY) the best they possibly can be and then work from there. Its like theyre building four amusement parks and moving on to building the next park instead of bothering to put any rides in the last one. However, I dont have a college degree and I dont run a corporation, so its not my place to criticize them for their business plan. I actually hope they put a little more attention into each thing they do, because Im genuinely rooting for them. \n ", "features": ["names of individuals", "phrases related to sports events and team news", "phrases related to legal matters and sports injuries", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "names of sports teams and players", "phrases related to decision-making or judgment"], "feature_ids": [2, 109, 19, 14, 18, 30], "scores": [0.98, 0.99, 0.01, 0.01, 0.98, 0.99]}

{"text": "How do you determine what color, say, a piece of paper is? You cant do it while shining red light on it, because then it would look red no matter what color it really is. Perfectly white paper will reflect whatever color is shining on it, and thus look like the light source itself. Under white light, a sheet of white paper will appear white. \n If you want to see the true color of an object, the best way to do that is to light it with a perfectly smooth, diffuse white light source (think a light box). Now imagine an ideal mirror being lit by such a light source -- perfectly smooth, even white light coming from all directions. What color would the mirror appear to be? White, of course. Perfect, pure white. Thats the actual color of a mirror, just as any other object would show you its true colors under such lighting. \n Mirrors dont actually appear to be silver -- they appear to be  whatever they are reflecting . Ideal mirrors are perfectly white in color, in the sense that they reflect exactly the same color of light that shines on them, just as a sheet of perfectly white paper does. Now, obviously theres a big difference between a mirror and a sheet of white paper, but it isnt the color. Its how they scatter light. Mirrors reflect light specularly (meaning the light bounces off at the same angle it came in at) while a sheet of white paper scatters the light in all directions. This is what allows a mirror to form an image: it doesnt scatter the light very much. A sheet of white paper is, in a very real sense, just an extremely blurry mirror: it takes on the color of whatever light is shining on it, but scatters it too much to form an image. \n Youll also see some people in this thread saying mirrors are green!. Now, its true that the glass that overlays the metal in common household mirrors has a very slight green tint. Its also true that the metal itself is not absolutely-perfectly-100% white. But if you were to carefully measure the color of a sheet of white paper using laboratory-grade equipment, and determine that it has an ever-so-slight green tint to it, you wouldnt run around saying That piece of a paper is green! just because it has an infinitesimal deviation from pure whiteness. Likewise, while no real-world mirror is perfectly white, neither is real-world paint or paper or anything else. Mirrors are still close enough to perfectly white that it would be silly to call them anything else. \n ", "features": ["mentions of the color red", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "phrases related to physical locations and travel", "phrases related to laws, regulations, enforcement, and criminal activities", "phrases related to technical and contractual information", "phrases related to expressing doubt or uncertainty", "phrases related to scientific research and organizations", "phrases related to expressing strong opinions or directives"], "feature_ids": [3, 14, 68, 556, 185, 90, 484, 607], "scores": [0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99]}

When I saw that ad from microsoft making fun of people who dont like IE it really made me angry. \n Even this weekend I have a client all pissed that an app I wrote for them is not working in ie8, Im using the jQuery datatables plugin and there are so many rows that the js engine in IE8 cant handle it (2000 rows) but it works in all other browsers. Im just going to tie an ajax call into the paging controls to fix it, but just as an example its another thing that IE fucks up. \n I had another project where I had to cut a PSD into a site for a client that was using ie7, they wanted things like drop shadows that you can click through, it was a nightmare. \n Back to the company in the image, I ended up finishing the project and got the latest version of wordpress and BuddyPress working in ie6. The users could not upgrade their browsers and they could not install chrome frame. I upgraded BuddyPress from RC01 to 1.3, there were major changes to the architecture and even paradigm of the product, 1.3 was much more twitter like than the release candidate. So even after I patched all of the CSS, converted their data to the new structure for BP1.3, and wrote several wordpress plugins to fill functionality gaps left by old code not compatible with the new buddypress, they still ended up not liking it because it was different. They knew they wanted the new buddypress because it had better security and new features, but once they saw the new way profiles and communication worked they disliked it and I got no praise. Like when facebook makes a change to their wall functionality and people start partitions. There is nothing I could have done about it thats just what BuddyPress had become and they asked me to upgrade it. \n So I performed a fucking miracle in 2 months and received no praise as the other co-op students got praise for performing simple tasks and writing simple queries, but whatever, I learned a lot about working in a corporation, I learned how to write plugins for buddypress, and I learned that Internet Explorer is the worst part of my life. \n This was all 2 years ago, and today I am fighting to leave development and become a systems analyst exclusively.

I honestly dont believe the division between HK people and Mainland Chinese stem from race but rather from misunderstanding of culture and maybe a tinge of jealousy. HKers are seeing these super rich Mainlanders as encroaching on their way of life and it does startle them (us). Its hard to swallow the fact that these uneducated, poor rural folk being top dogs because money is everything. It just doesnt sit well with most HKers. But it is what it is and again, the problem is not race but culture. HKers being brought from British rule has accepted certain ideals that make them feel cosmopolitan and forward. The flood of Mainland tourists (most, not all) are relatively uneducated and before they became super rich from their land were essentially farmers. I think this is the mentality that Hong Kongers dont understand. If they dont cut in line, fight for the spot on the bus, push and shove, they wont make the days earnings and their family goes hungry.

{"text": "Tall ship sailing. \n Long story: I met my boyfriend when we were both studying abroad, and we ended up being thrown together during several outings and would often chat about our lives, hobbies, music we liked, etc. At one point we were on the subject of tattoos, and that was when he proudly showed me his large tattoo of a ballentine on his shoulder and explained its purpose and significance. Hed been sailing on historical schooners in mid-coast Maine every summer since he was 12. \n Before that moment, I had NO idea that something like that even existed. It was never on my radar, and I had never been exposed to any activity remotely like it before. But as my boyfriend continued to wax on about boat life, living out on the water, sleeping in a small bunk and working hard, long hours in one of the most beautiful sailing grounds in the world, I couldnt help but be caught up in the romance of it. \n So, immediately after graduating college, I trekked up to Maine and sailed on a schooner for 7 months - living and working on the boat. I worked in the galley for 16 hours a day, squeezed in next to our magician of a cook, working over a hot wood-burning stove. Wed cook meals for 30, and host passengers on the boat for up to a week at a time. I was on my feet and working from 5:30 in the morning until 10 at night. When I wasnt in the galley I was up on deck, helping the deck crew sail the boat. When we were in port wed have to fully strip, clean, and re-stock the entire boat in preparation for the next trip. Id spend most of my time on those days hauling firewood from the top of the dock back down into the galley in individual milk crates. Wed have maybe one night off a week, if we were lucky. \n After about a month, my hands were shredded and calloused, my hair was bleached from sun, I had one of the most insane farmers tans ever, and I had lost nearly 15 pounds - all replaced by muscle in my arms, back, and thighs from constantly hauling on lines and hefting large loads of food or firewood. I was always salty and a little smelly from only being able to shower once a week. But I had absolutely never felt better in my life. I felt alive and vibrant, I loved my fellow crew members and captain, as well as the entire sailing community that thrives and is a major source of income for that area. I was truly and completely happy. \n I can honestly say the season I spent living and working on the schooner was the best time of my life, and now I can share my love of tall ship sailing with my boyfriend, and I can never thank him enough for introducing me to it.

{"text": "Some thoughts on this: \n I cant help but feel like a season as underwhelming as this one had been coming for a long time. Weve been a pretty good team for the last 5 or 6 years, but we benefited from being able to beat up on other teams in the weak Northwest Division. Since 2011, due to mainly to mismanagement, our team has slowly gotten worse while our competition has stiffened. Our new division now contains three of the toughest teams in the NHL, so its unsurprising weve had a rough season. Should we have expected the season to go as poorly as it did? No, but most analysts had us pegged as a team on the bubble this year at best, so were very far removed from the team that won back-to-back Presidents Trophies. \n I was always a Torts supporter, but Im happy to embrace the clean slate mentality Linden has brought in since being named President. I am, however, upset that we didnt fire Gillis when we fired AV. It would have made more sense to have cleaned house last year, hired a new coach  and  GM, and begun retooling the team this season. Instead, our organization has been rudderless for an entire season, with the players, coach, GM, and owner all on different pages, and the fans left clueless as to the direction the team was going in. My best guess is now were going to have at least one more season of extreme mediocrity while the team makes changes and re-adjusts. \n I liked Torts. I liked his passion and his honesty. Most of all I liked his press conferences. I will miss watching them. I think its unfair the way hes been judged by the media and fans here. We gave him little to work with and expected him to right a ship that was sinking fast, and he probably wasnt the right guy for the job. Im still not sure how to feel about the firing. Only time will tell. \n Ive always tried to stay positive, but today I feel scared. Its looking like this team wont be competitive for the next couple seasons. In an NHL that gets tougher and tougher every minute, we have an aging core and a tier of very unproven and untested prospects. The Sedins, Bieksa, Kesler, Hamhuis and all our other core guys will probably be retired or shipped out before this team gets a whiff of Stanley Cup action again. Im scared were headed back to the dog days of the late 90s. Im scared that we just arent cut out to compete in an NHL that gets more competitive with every passing day. Im scared that were supposed to hang our hat on a guy like Bo Horvat, who may never amount to be more than a third line centre. Im scared that the ownership and management are letting the fans call the shots rather than doing what they think is right. Most of all Im scared the fans will turn on Linden like theyve turned on so many others, and that we will ruin the one untainted thing in our teams history. \n Firing Torts was probably the right way to go, but I cant help but feel like so much has gone wrong up to this point that its going to take years to correct.

When Im not on Vyvanse, it feels like I have multiple ways of trying to convey my thoughts, but then it comes out all jumbled when I speak. It wasnt too big of a deal, most people just caught on though when I started to mumble in order to hide it.

I find myself speaking A LOT the first couple days, and Im sure its a combo of the initial rush and being relieved that I can now speak again without issues. \n Other than the speech improvements, Ive curbed any kind of bad habit that I had.

{"text": "This will be down to the hierarchy of Man and System. When you write, using a pen and paper, you are using tools that cannot harm you in any way without the direct intervention of a fellow human. You can be stabbed by a pencil, or cut by paper, but only if you/someone who doesnt like you thrusts the pencil into your skin, or slices the paper along your skin. \n On the other hand, a computer has the potential to kill us all without our direct actions, though it does require a specific set of circumstances. A computer which controls nuclear armaments in a country like Russia or the United States of America, two mutually antagonistic states, can very easily malfunction if power fails, or surges, and thus cause the release of a nuclear weapon, thereby destroying the world. \n Furthermore, we are slaves to the computer, but not to the paper. At least not to the same degree. Many a time Ive read comments from fellow Redditors, bemoaning the addictiveness of the site. Such an addictiveness is not exclusive to this site, but to computers in general, which is why they continue to sell in ever larger numbers despite being constantly released  in ever larger numbers . People love a good computer. \n But be honest with yourself, when was the last time you had the same experience with a single piece of paper, which is either entirely blank or has at least enough blank space to write on? (This is so that its a fair comparison, which a Wilfred Owen poem would not be). Which blank piece of paper has the powers to engross you such that you lose track of time? \n Id wager the answer is none. And therein lies the answer to this particular Showerthought. The poor white man of 19th Century America did not, in general, speak up for the black slaves, because while there were black slaves, they werent the lowest. They outranked someone in society. Fortunately, that has changed now, and its not commonplace or acceptable for black people - or any people, for that matter - to be kept as slaves in any of the worlds major societies. Yet we are slaves to the computer, every single one of us, and we can do nothing to stop it. Except remain silent. \n The computer has the potential to eradicate the traditional paper, consign it to obscurity forever. The only boundaries? Battery life, which still may not be enough in a serious emergency, and our own human inability to change. There is a deep-set nostalgia for the days of Paper, before computers, and that will always be innate within us. Nobody truly wants to see paper gone from this world, for then we lose all societal connections with the Earth of centuries gone by. This is why paper remains, and why it will always remain. \n Yet it seems we have a fear of what will happen if we change our semantics. We cannot claim the top rung of existence without lying to ourselves, for we know we are slaves to Computers, yet we cannot elevate Paper above ourselves, because if we were to do that, we would relegate ourselves to the bottom of the human world. And nobody can face the idea of being inferior to our own creations, because that would make us failures, obsoletes, with no place in the regime. So, just like the impoverished Victorian white men of America, we hold our peace, and hope somebody braver than ourselves will speak up for poor Paper, and spare it from the plight it undergoes every day. \n Somebody, somewhere, has to have a dream that one day, on the red hills of Georgia, sons of Paper and sons of Computers will be able to bear our information together at the Library of Brotherhood, but it will not be anybody in our lifetime. Computers are the real Big Brother, the real Catch-22. They have made our lives easier, made us lazier, more likely to procrastinate, to make excuses, to pass responsibilities onto the shoulders of others. This will not change in time. \n No, we will become less likely to speak up, as we have a comfortable place here, not high enough to threaten the Computers and be picked off by them, and not low enough that we are trampled by all else in human society. We look down on the Paper, though we do it with a fond tear in the corner of our eye, and we hope we can find the courage to end their suffering. \n Not that we will, of course, for an endless cycle takes place. While the three constants of Man, Paper, and Computer, all coexist, none can realistically end or be emancipated. Paper cannot be freed with Computer still in pride of place, and Man cannot function in the modern society, if he hopes to prosper and rise to the top of his own class, without the aid of Computer to level the playing fields. Computer is a machine, and does not care what happens to Man or Paper, for it will continue to perform its calculations, and talk its binary, to the end of time, or until the motherboard decays and becomes fetid sludge. \n Yet Man can fix Computer, and replace the motherboards, and upgrade them, and delay the inevitable, and, being Man, he does so. And so as long as Man lives, Computer lives, and as long as Computer lives, Paper can never surmount Computer, and as long as Man lives, Paper lives, and lives below Man, and thus the three constants of our informational world are set in stone. \n Computer has absolute power, and Man is just below, and Paper is just below that, both classes perpetually on the edge of self-sufficiency, and independence, but never quite reaching it. That is the way of things now, and it always will be. But Man, despite sitting saf\u0259ly in his niche, creates the language. Oh, how he creates the language. \n And Man is self-centred, so the language will always reflect in equal parts honesty to the true reality, and fuel to Mans ego. Man is in the middle, and information must be transferred to the edge to be useful. It can be passed  down  the hierarchy, by written word, or it can be passed  up  up the hierarchy, by transference to the higher power of the computer (did you notice I put the word up in there twice?) \n Hence the reasons why your statement is currently correct, and will remain a correct statement until even the end of Time itself is but a distant memory. Until some brave knight of Smeg comes to challenge the order of things, armed with the cheat codes to life, there is no way equilibrium will shift. After all, this isnt like the movies. The good guys never win, theres no fairytale ending. \n Not for us. \n And definitely not for Paper, which will remain at the bottom, a slave to reality, until the end of even ends. For although the pen is mightier than the sword, the light which it stabs burns not nearly as bright. \n Accept it, it is the way of all things. This is an immutable fact. True, youve done nothing wrong, technically, by this statement, but dont let it escalate, lest you question the ways of the Computers.

{"text": "Well, Im not going to post all my thoughts on Nidalee, since it would be a really long comment on a thread thats already 15 hours old, but Ill put in a shortened version of it. In my opinion, Nidalees primary issues stem from her very powerful heal, her high mobility, and the inconsistency of her javelins. \n My major changes would involve lowering the base damage and AP ratio of her javelin by a fair margin, but significantly increasing the missile speed to make them more consistent. I want Nidalee to be able to rain spears from afar during a siege, but I want to see consistent, reliable damage as opposed to an occasional brutal hit. I agree with you that her heal needs a pretty big drop on the ratio. Id like to see some of that AP ratio moved to the attack speed bonus, though. It would place a larger emphasis on the offensive nature of her heal and reinforce her role as a strong siege champion. As to Nidalees mobility, I think that its too reliable in any situation. She can escape all but the stickiest champions (Lee Sin, Kassadin, etc.) even if shes just running straight down a lane. I would increase the cooldown on Pounce significantly; at least double what it is now. To compensate, I would increase the movement speed bonus on her passive and make Pounce dash farther to incentivize sneaky paths across walls and through the jungle rather than directly away from her opposition. \n This comment still ended up a lot longer than I intended, but thats the general idea of where I think Nidalees problems lie and how I would fix them, given the chance.

The Bars also tell lawyers to report other lawyers they suspect have a problem. \n Divorce is typically done through whats called equitable distribution. Doesnt necessarily mean split everything in half, but everyone gets about the same value (ie: you get a car worth $10k, she gets 10k worth of jewelry to balance it). Theres always one spouse claiming theyre going to take everything, but thats just not how its done, pretty much never. \n Grandmas apartment: depends on if his name is on the title, if mom had it before the marriage, and if marital assets are used to pay on it and upkeep it. A lawyer can look at this and tell you whats up, but like I said with the equitable distribution: mom will probably get to keep it, but dad may end up getting some extra money from the bank account instead.  If dads name isnt on the title, he cant do anything to grandparents until the court decides what interest he has in the property. Even then, grandparents are tenants (even without a lease) and he cannot remove them unless he formally evicts them (he cant just throw grandmas wheelchair outside on a whim). \n College fund: do you actually have a college fund?

But what need is there to compare the validity of grief between two people in different situations? \n If you must, maybe its worth considering what it means to her.  Maybe she lives alone, and doesnt have any friends that spend time with her outside of work.  So, basically, that dog was the only living being that she willingly related to on a daily basis.  Maybe it cheered up a lonely and otherwise empty life every day, and was a constant presence outside the office.  Maybe that dog bringing his leash to her or trying to get her to play is the thing that more often then not got her off the couch at night, or kept her from sleeping past noon every weekend.  Maybe all of her hobbies revolved around the dog... (dog park, dog walks, dog shows).  If you have a little pal whos with you when you exercise, when you eat, when you do chores, and when you lounge around at night, that pal becomes a giant part of your life, and there is a tremendous emotional investment there.  If they are suddenly ripped away from you, every moment of your home life becomes a reminder.  You cant cook without seeing the empty spot he used to watch you work in.  You cant watch TV without accidentally reaching over to scratch a head that isnt there.  Instead of coming home to a burst of excitement and happiness at the door, you have to come home to a quiet lonely room.  When a dog owner feels down, she can go hug her buddy and know--every time--that some little being is happy that shes there, no matter how much of a bad mood shes in.  Take all that away, add the feeling that you lost your best friend, and consider the isolation inherent in the fact that most people around you are seeing your grief and instead of sympathizing, are thinking why doesnt she stop making a big deal about this and get a new one?...and I think you can understand that the loss of a dog can be an enormous blow for a particular type of person. \n Perhaps there are many people who would criticize anyone who lets a dog become that important to them, but once it is done, you have to recognize that having your best pal suddenly ripped away from you (as is often the case with dogs) can be very painful.  All she was trying to convey to you is that she understood the feeling of loss, and shared with you the most recent or powerful thing that has aggrieved her.   How does it even occur to you to think its insulting that her pain doesnt come from exactly the same type of loss as yours? \n ", "features": ["phrases related to expressing personal opinions or perspectives", "phrases related to expressing doubt or uncertainty"], "feature_ids": [281, 90], "scores": [0.98, 0.02]}

{"text": "Baltimore was the primary destination for free blacks in colonial America, and has long since maintained a robust black business community. The stereotype of black people not tipping has some historical truth. Historically on train cars blacks would serve white riders and act out in a buffoon caricature for tips. Malcolm X even did this for a time and it fed his disdain for cooperating with whites in the future. Therefore tipping has taken on a form of asymmetric power, reproducing racial and class antagonisms, that do not favor black people. Generally speaking, black politicians have advocated for government intervention into the economy (march on Washington was about jobs and lead by a communist), not because wealthy blacks do not give back (i.e. tipping), as Donald Sterling too suggested, but because private entities dont have the infrastructure or scale to distribute resources adequately. Furthermore, people of European descent benefited disproportionately from FDRs New Deal. At the time, national origin quotas cut off European immigration, leaving an aging population with Social Security benefits in the North. Meanwhile, southern democrats required the New Deal programs be administered locally to cut out blacks in the segregated south. See Ira Katsnelson, When Affirmative Action was White. Therefore when the the government did redistribute wealth and create Americas largest proportional middle class, it largely benefited whites, while excluding blacks. Today, the Black Caucus in Congress considers raising the minimum wage to be a policy issue that disproportionately effects the black community. Therefore it is reasonable to infer that most black people would prefer servers be paid a living wage than have to perform an act for tips. Additionally, given the historical contingencies, this explanation is far more likely than the racist trope that there is some inherent selfishness all black people share that prevents them from giving back. \n ", "features": ["phrases related to racial disparities, discrimination, and social inequities", "phrases related to controversial topics and opinions", "phrases related to expressing strong opinions or directives"], "feature_ids": [469, 406, 607], "scores": [0.98, 0.99, 0.95]}

Bad grips, low quality materials that will break, etc. Sears sells a good screwdriver set that has every size head and length of shaft you could need. You only need Phillips and flatheads - some sets may come with Torx (star) drivers. \n A hammer is a hammer. Some people like wooden handles, other poly/fiberglass. Whatever floats your boat - just make sure the head is attached. Youll use it to hang pictures mostly. \n A good pipe wrench is great to have around. Youll be able to take the trap off a sink if it gets clogged and do other pipe-related stuff. A crescent wrench is nice also for this (get a few sizes) - not as heavy duty, but good for smaller diameters and can even be used for nuts and bolts. You said you have a ratchet set already, so you should be good there. \n Plungers and toilet augers - self explanatory - you dont want to be wading in crap. Get the bellows kind or the kind with the cup hanging off the bottom, not the flat bottomed type. The flat bottom is a sink plunger. Toilet augers are good for breaking up clogs when a plunger wont work. \n Thats all you really need, until you start doing home improvement stuff. Next thing to get would be a nice power drill.

Rift also has BY FAR the best pricing model of any currently popular MMO. Edit: compared to most of the other titles on the list, Rifts PvP is pretty lackluster, so if that is your thing Id encourage you to try other titles. \n \n WoW is moving in the direction of Rift with the new open world bosses and treasure hunting, but in the end WoW endgame really only has raiding to do (though there is LFR). For someone used to Rift, WoW feels disturbingly static and gets boring fast IMO.

Wildstar emphasizes raiding at end-game, including trying to resurrect 40-player raids. Wildstar also has quite an elaborate player housing setup, though a Rift player who enjoys dimensions might be disappointed.

{"text": "So, when I was 9, my family would go out walking with our neighbours into the woods around our house once every couple of weeks or so, and we kids (myself, my brother, and two of the neighbours) would bring our bikes and go riding around for a bit if the parents were resting. During one of these little adventures into the woods, we found a  very  large slope (about 20m drop and 45\u00b0 incline, it was damn big especially back then), with a rope swing at the top. So, what did we do? Of course, we all went on it. So, were all having fun, and its about my 4th go, and suddenly I hear a cracking sound as Im just starting. Not that I think anything of it. So I reach the end of the swing, and start to come back, and the seat jolts down maybe half a metre or so, then right at the bottom of the arc the rope snaps and I go flying, backwards, into this slope. Everything goes black. I wake up, lying on my back at the bottom of the slope.

{"text": "My thoughts on Titanfall: \n Skill \n Titanfall is one of the few FPS games since Halo 2 where I feel that skill has a huge factor in how well you personally do. I played all of the Halo series and most of the CoD series, and while I can die just as fast as in a CoD game, i never seem to die as much. This is the beauty of the movement in this game, when someone starts shooting me I have more tools to dodge and escape. Positioning, much like CoD and Halo, is always key and being in the right place will net you tons of points. Knowing how and where to go when being shot allows me to escape death about 70% of the time. \n Teamwork \n Above i chose the word  personally  for a very specific reason. Titanfall is a game about teamwork, which is very unlike the halo and CoD counterparts to a degree. In Halo and CoD, one player can carry a team on his/her back without ever talking or considering the team at all. I believe that without Titans, Titanfall Attrition and Pilot hunter would fall into the same realm as CoD and Halo. Its easy to rack up 100 points in Attrition if you are good at it, but good teamwork with titans will net you way more points than a single person can acquire. Most losses I have are because the other team was more coordinated. \n Maps and Gameplay \n I love the maps. There are a few maps I prefer less, but none that I hate playing on and I think this is the beauty of Titanfall. The core gameplay is so much fun that the maps and even winning is secondary to that. I dont ever really mind losing in Titanfall because even when blown out 300-150 ill still look back fondly at the game for the little moments. It probably helps that last night when we lost 5 straight i had a 6.0 average k/d......but point is the little moments in the game are what makes it fun. Each encounter was a story and an experience. \n What went wrong \n Titanfall isnt without its faults of course, the main one being some of the optimization and issues with certain rigs. I own the PC version and while I havent had many issues, it certainly is taxing on certain computers. I am happy with the playlists currently available and wouldnt mind seeing more, but I also dont want to fragment the community more. What I really want to see is a better matching algorithm for groups. \n I see it more heavily in LTS, but it seems that they prefer making a full team and then matching teams up rather than just making a lobby and filling that up. When you create a team with 2 Gen 10s, a gen 8, 2 gen 5s and a gen 1......how many teams are really going to be of equal skill to that. Id much rather just be placed into the lobby and have the system process one player at a team into a team that needs someone of that skill. \n Also the complaining about there being higher gens on the other team was so toxic to the game. I wish they exposed player skill to everyone just so people would realize just how bad some of the higher gens are (especially when doing certain challenges). The game has been out nearly 3 months, if you are gen 1 expect to be the lowest in the lobby. \n ", "features": ["phrases related to expressing strong opinions or directives"], "feature_ids": [607], "scores": [0.22]}

{"text": "Jman5, I disagree with you (and apparently PGI) on the current assessment of auto-cannons.  Currently auto-cannons are where they need to be in my opinion (except the AC2 nerf which I am still mad about TBH).  You show, quite correctly, that ballistic dps is a lower drop off rate than energy weapons.  Where we disagree is whether or not this is a good thing.  I argue that nerfing the remaining AC weapons is a mistake because that extra damage trade off comes because it balances out with ammo consumption.  If the ballistics suffer from slower projectile speed, high reload times, and the same range effects as the laser weaponry where are their advantages?  Energy weapons continue to enjoy the benefit of no ammo consumption while ballistics are gutted again to make them disproportionately weak.  I really dont understand the obsession with auto-cannons and nerfing anything except PPCs. The one common denominator weapon in every single jump snipe and or meta build is the PPC yet by nerfing the AC, still having broken SRMs, and the excess ghost heat on LLs and LPLs you severely limit the viable alternatives. Ive been a PP and Clan purchaser but I feel like were just going farther down this road of the PPC master race. Disappointed to say the least. \n EDIT: Condensed replies \n Ill agree with you on the LL/ERLL as I think they are in a bad place as a weapon. At a minimum I think the GH threshold on them needs to go to 3 from 2. \n Heres the problem I have with your points. First, pinpoint is not universally true for a couple of reasons. First of all the LBX-10 suffers from the same drawbacks as the ACs without the benefit of being pinpoint. Now, if LBXs get left out of this nerf I will be happier but it doesnt really make sense does it? Why would a shotgun type weapon then have better damage than a rifle type weapon. \n Next heat, some ACs suffer from high heat penalties, some do not. Its hard to argue that the entire class of weapons deserves the nerf when heat is not uniformly applied in the weapons. If AC2s had the same heat to dps as a AC20 then I could live with it, but each one has a different ratio of heat generation. Dakka heat ratios AC20: 20:6 AC2: 2:1 AC5: 5:1 AC10: 10:3 Gauss: 15:1 LBX10: 10:2 UAC5: 5:1. For the sake of the argument lets drop off the LXB and gauss because they are exceptions to the rule for ballistics. So then, if we are to accept that all these ballistics are universally pinpoin (which is partially true due to splash damage) we would still not want to apply the same range restrictions to them. AC2s suffer disproportionally to this nerf compared to all other ballistic types. This is due to their faster firing rate and the fact that they are the only ballistic greatly effected by GH. AC2s have the perfect combination of low range, low damage, higher than normal heat and now a slower recycle time to see their viability drop substantially and given that the meta was never OMG PGI AC2S PLS NERF I do not understand the logic of changing it. It is simply a fact that these weapons are not heat neutral. The highest heat efficient ballistic, AC5s, are used most often when paired with PPCs. If you need to get ride of the sniping meta, or at least tone it down, why isnt the target either only that weapon or the PPCs themselves? This simply doesnt make sense. Next in line for negative effects in the AC10, which already sees limited use. Its combination of weight, slots, lower ammo count and damage to heat ratio make it a difficult fit within the game. \n And for all of you saying that ballistics having the pin point advantage over lasers I see that none of you wants to really address the fact that PPCs are pinpoint as well and require no ammo. a PPC is a dmg to heat ration of 1:1 which seems really high until we compare it to another weapon. Again if we take the equivalent of 1 PPC worth of ballistics via AC2s it would take 5 weapons systems to match the pinpoint hit (which would be even more splash than the PPC would incur). Not only that but the GH on the AC system would kick in and you would generate more heat with those 5 systems than off of the one PPC. Are ballistics better than lasers? For the most part yes. Are lasers the real problem? No, not even close. LLs and ERLLs should never have been limited to a GH of 2 and sure as heck not grouped with LPLs for heat purposes. \n TL:DR Ballistics, in some cases, are just as hot per damage generated as energy weapons and their nerf further ensures the PPCs domination as the direct fire king on the battlefield. \n", "features": ["phrases related to contentious or divisive topics in politics or society", "phrases related to expressing strong opinions or directives", "phrases related to sports events and team news", "phrases related to technical specifications and features", "phrases related to expressing doubt or uncertainty", "phrases related to decision-making or judgment"], "feature_ids": [320, 607, 109, 300, 90, 30], "scores": [0.02, 0.88, 0.0, 0.82, 0.12, 0.74]}

{"text": "Yes. Very yes. \n Now, thats not to say I lo-ball everything. I make sure things are damn challenging, and there are times when I do end up killing characters, but sometimes thinks shift one way or another. A few examples: \n \n A (greater) invisible caster throws out confusion and a few other fun things. The party eventually manages to stop themselves from killing each other and undo some debuffs, but none of them can see invisible or negate it in any way. OH LOOK! She accidentally cast Greater Invisibility a few turns  before  the party entered the room instead of right before. Why? Because the party has survived a major threat (confusion, which nearly killed them), overcome it (and a couple summons), and have spent efforts to push things along (randomly attacking squares, casting area spells unsuccessfully, etc.). If the invisibility kept going for another five rounds, nothing would really happen. The party would just be bored and annoyed. \n Last night, my players went up against an undead level 8 cleric. They were average level 6, so this was supposed to be very challenging. After the first round (Unholy Blight), the archer-rogue ran away. And if he kept running, he would have lived.

It wasnt like the fight was close to ending or he would really do anything else; the boss was supposed to lay down some spells then channel things to death. \n On the other side of the spectrum, the big awesome demon boss makes his big reveal and opens with spell. The party makes their save, and the cavalier spirited-charge-mounted-lance-crits him for stupid amounts of damage. Combat over? ...OH LOOK! The demon had Stone Flesh cast on him, so instead of being at -30 hp, hes actually at 40. He might last one or two more rounds, and hell target the strongest PCs and spread his tactics around so no one actually dies. Why did he suddenly have that buffer? Because one-shotting the boss is at best a quick bragging-right for one player, but a cool, interesting fight with stuff unique to that battle where everyone contributes is a story for the whole party.

Toplaner getting small wolves when duojungling, botlane ADC killing enemy Zyra plants or anyone farming pretty well but missing all Cannon minions can mean a lot of gold difference that does not show in CS number. \n 2) Gold bounty for CS scales with time.

In one of the LCS  games played this week  even casters realized this.

{"text": "First of all, that is absolutely a pain in the ass to do, and I am not capable of it. I tried, and all I got out of it was a good rant. Haha. \n I have no problems sharing the story, but its uh. A bit involved and for any redditors browsing through it is very dark. Abuse and rape and just bad. So,  if youre still recovering from your own terrible experience, please consider skipping this story if memories like this will harm you . \n On my end, the memories are distant in my head, and its been eight years now, so its not so bad. I was in a really terrible, highly abusive relationship in high school. It started because... Well, because I wanted to be friends with him. He reminded me of someone Id cared for a lot as a small child. Somehow everyone thought I had a crush on him - I had at first thought so as well, but then I realised I just felt so deeply, terribly sorry for him. He was horribly depressed, and I wanted to help. And then, just after wed started talking (online, naturally, people open up so much more via text), hed ended up in a horrible accident, and then somehow... \n Well, when he finally came back to school, a lot of his friends didnt know how to treat him. I just kind of sat, and listened, and was compassionate. I ended up going to homecoming with him, we ended up dating, we broke up again because it was...not so good. Not horrible, but nothing like it ended up. \n We were still friends, we hung out. One night, we were hanging out with others, alcohol got involved (Id tried a bit, not liked it, but then more was added to my drink without my knowledge in gradually increasing doses). I felt very strange, and he kept dragging me into a room away from the others - I fled, went to the bathroom and locked myself in, talked to myself in the mirror a bit. Talked myself into  going back out there  because I was afraid hed be hurt or upset if I didnt. Everyone else had gone to bed at this point. He raped me. We werent dating at the time, and he was in fact sort of dating someone else (on again, off again relationship, they were at an off again). \n Things escalated when he decided we were dating again. He was...twisted. Finally, we were at a friends place, he was really depressed and sitting alone in the dark in the kitchen while others were in the bedroom watching something on television (a Mudvayne concert, I think). I was comforting him, but he wouldnt look at me. So, I got down on my knees on the floor by his chair, and was quiet. He...snapped. Quietly, coldly, and he shoved me to the floor, climbed on top of me with his knees jamming into my inner elbows, and his hands closed around my throat. \n I was shocked. Hed hurt me before, of course - deliberately, with absolute intention, and informed me that if I stopped him he would kill my mother. Hurt me was too small an idea. My mother was someone who, while we fought, I would never allow to be hurt - shed suffered enough in her own life, a stroke and two abusive marriages, and still held such good humor. I couldnt let anything happen to her. This, I think, is what made me easy to hurt. I let him, to keep her safe, I was convinced hed somehow manage it (and he might have, she actually liked him, and it would have been easy for him to get to her). So, when he was upset or angry or unhappy, I payed. He would pin me into place, and calmly, oh so calmly, and very methodically, slice lines in my lower arms. Not the insides, never there! Oh no, that might slip, and then what would he do? \n So, my life up to this point had deteriorated into near madness. Everyone in our small school knew I cut myself. This, to give them their due, was not false. The second the cut started to scab over, Id reopen the wound - in a way, it was my way of taking back control. Oh, they would all scar! But at least in the future I could look at them and know those scars were  mine . Well, I did say madness, didnt I. \n So, when those hands closed around my throat, I couldnt help but kind of feel relieved. I would die, and it would be done. I felt awful for my family, and most of all quietly sorry that my friends who cared so much would never know the truth of what had happened to me. (One of whom saw the marks on my arms at one point and told me that if I needed to hurt myself so much, shed do it for me - at least then shed know someone would be watching out for me after! Well, she meant well, and shed meant it as a threat. She had determined I was mad when I laughed a little and told her it wasnt necessary - how could she have known it was already like that?) My throat was searing, and I couldnt even swallow - Id tried, once. Hed tightened his hold until I swore I felt blood, and then things got fuzzy. It was painful, so, so painful, worse than any asthma attack Id ever had. There were dots, swimming, but I just...stared at him. \n Which, by the way, convinced me he was mad. Surely your victim just quietly, calmly staring into your eyes would give anyone the willies! Well, just as I was beginning to get tunnel vision, the bedroom door opened and he let go and slid away. I dont think the person who came out knows it, but he inadvertently saved my life that night. His girlfriend, whom I was becoming friends with, though...She had suspected something, and had sent him out. Despite being in a tough place herself, with divorced parents and a disabled sister (lovely girl, but she could have difficult days and was often depressed herself) and a boyfriend who was overly attached, she did her best to help me. \n I told my mother, the moment I got home. He played along, and nothing scared me so much as that. I was right to have been scared, he insisted the car accident had given him PTSD, and that was what made him choke me. (I, like a twit, only told her of that. And, because when Id told her about the night he raped me, she had seemed less than horrified and in fact, in reply to my insisting it was awful and I hadnt wanted it, asked if hed at least enjoyed it. I didnt say rape and I didnt say Id told him no at the time, so I suppose she just thought it had been unpleasant and that was the bit I hadnt wanted. So Id just assumed it wasnt so bad as I thought.) \n He got help, after we told his parents. They took him into the hospital, he got put on Prozac, and then the real nightmare began. \n If youve experienced horrible things, but have read to here, it does get very bad. Again, if this could cause you to have any sort of reaction that will harm you (panic attacks, flashbacks) PLEASE stop reading. \n If it stormed at night, he would show up at my house (country, the back door wouldnt lock properly, my mom and step-dad were in the other end of the trailer, and he could drive while I couldnt) and beat me. Sometimes he would rape me, sometimes hed just cut me. I have a scar just to the right (my right, not an observers) of the labia majora, right in the little crease caused by the thigh. Its probably the worst thing he ever did to me, given that he cut it open and burned it closed. \n In public, however...we were an adorable couple. Id compartmentalized so much that it was hard to tell anything was wrong, I hadnt changed much. He proposed (At this distance I get offended, because he got me diamonds, and he knew I thought they were boring.) and put the ring on my finger. I just let him, as we were in public and it was expected. \n My only comfort in all of this horror is that, while he did rape me, hed always used a condom. Imagine my surprise, then, when a few months after we get engaged (keep in mind this is my senior year of high school, as well) when I discover Im pregnant. Well, suddenly we arent engaged anymore. My mother never leaves me alone so I cant get out to an abortion clinic. And he threatens to kill my mother if I get an abortion, anyway. \n But then, he made his first mistake. He attacked me while I was pregnant, and Id had enough. Let him kill my mother, let him try. And maybe, if I fought back, maybe I could protect her. And myself. And this little thing inside of me leeching my energy and my joy and all of my future. It hadnt done anything wrong, of course, and it didnt deserve to be treated this way, and while I hated it with everything I had, I wouldnt let it suffer. \n So, when he pushed me to the ground and wrapped his hands around my neck again, I went still. As he expected me to, and as he expected me to, he didnt pin my arms down. I took the deepest breath I could, he cut air off completely, and after a second or two, I punched him as hard as I could in the solar plexus, and when he let go of my neck in shock, I pushed the skinny man I had let walk all over me away, stood up, and told him to get out. My mother heard  that  at least, and came back - having an audience, the monster had the nerve to play it off like it was me being angry over nothing, and left. \n He tried hitting me one last time, outside on our porch, and I backhanded him hard enough to knock him off the stairs. \n Eight years later, Im away from him, in a happy relationship, and actually just managed for the first time in my life to write the worst things down. So, yeah. Thats the story. I have all sorts of scars, but Im still kicking! \n ", "features": ["mentions of the color red", "phrases related to physical locations and travel", "phrases related to legal matters and sports injuries", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "phrases related to conflicts, injustices, and tragedies", "phrases related to informing or recounting events", "phrases related to expressing strong opinions or directives", "phrases related to decision-making or judgment", "phrases related to expressing doubt or uncertainty"], "feature_ids": [3, 68, 19, 14, 25, 36, 607, 30, 90], "scores": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.99, 0.99, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]}

{"text": "Heres one way to look at it. \n Pro-life people, myself included, have a certain view of the unborn: that is, that the unborn is a person, complete with the rights of a person, especially and particularly the right to life. \n Heres the main reason you might see politicians hold to exceptions for rape and incest (even though you only list rape, usually there are three exceptions: harm towards the mother, rape, and incest; the first is less like the other two, so Ill just lump the last two together): it is nearly impossible to get legislation passed that is considered radical, on either side. So, pro-lifers push for incremental legislation: first well push bans on 20-week and after abortions, and we can use the capability for physical, measurable pain as the cut-off point. Then, well have some ground to talk about persons who are smaller than the 20-week mark weve now made legal. \n It is much easier to go from 20-weeks to 12 weeks to no abortions than it is to go from at-will abortions through the second trimester to no abortions. Larger leaps are more difficult to pass, plain and simple. \n Likewise, it is easier to pass a law regarding abortion with a rape and incest provision because people feel quite strongly about those (particularly the first). Most of these folks would still hold that you shouldnt end the life of the unborn baby, but recognize that the accompanying law still reduce abortions. And if you can only have abortions in those cases, we can now push for appropriate psychological care, counseling, and the like for women who have been raped and are seeking abortions.

He had a PPG season, in which he tied for scoring lead and then was voted the best player in the league by his peers. He is fairly average sized, could likely bulk up a little for North American hockey but as weve seen undersized forwards can obviously contribute. Fletch said our scouts felt he was ready for North American hockey, with how well he did in SM-liiga I am inclined to believe him. For comparison Granlund only had one year at PPG in SM-Liiga (Though 4 years younger then Keranen) and he never won the Oksanen. Its very likely he can contribute in the NHL, and has the potential to be serviceable forward. Yeo turned Haula a similar player into a dominant 4th liner, so who knows what we are going to see. \n [Source]( \n TL:DR \n Start the hype train \n", "features": ["names of individuals", "sports-related discussions or updates", "phrases related to physical locations and travel", "names of sports teams and players", "phrases related to decision-making or judgment", "phrases related to expressing doubt or uncertainty", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "phrases related to showcasing or demonstrating something"], "feature_ids": [2, 43, 68, 18, 30, 90, 14, 13], "scores": [0.98, 0.92, 0.02, 0.98, 0.06, 0.04, 0.0, 0.82]}

{"text": "This is going to be long, because it hits home and I have a lot to say on the matter. \n I was the other half in a very similar situation. It took me about six months to stop getting suspicious when I saw my husband (then boyfriend) texting someone, after our incident.\u201d I snooped. I pried. I obsessed. And I don\u2019t regret it. I still loved him, but I didn\u2019t trust him, and I had reason not to trust him. But I wanted to, so I stayed, and I worked on myself and our relationship. Once I realized I was sick of him announcing who he was texting and handing me his phone to see his conversations, I realized I was pretty much over it. Like I said, it took about six months. (Incidentally, you should be offering up the information yourself. It helped me immensely.) \n Yeah, its going to suck a bit. Sorry. You cheated and you got a second chance, do whatever you need to do to make her not regret it--that is, if you want to. If you dont, of course, youre within your rights to call the relationship off. \n But here\u2019s something I didn\u2019t see anyone else address, and you should be warned of it now. Dry spells happen and will continue to happen. You probably feel good about being faithful right now because the incident is fresh in your mind and your sex life is in an upswing. But this is not going to be permanent. \n In our case, I engaged (at the time unknowingly) in what is evidently called hysterical bonding, where I just wanted to have sex with him all the time. Part of it was the drive to not let another dry spell happen again for fear of what would happen. Part of it was just some deep, bizarre, biological NEED to assert my dominance as the #1 woman in his life. For me this phase actually lasted a few months. That didnt mean Id entirely forgiven or forgotten, in fact it was just the opposite. And around the time I\u2019d gotten over the entire incident, sex had dropped back to about twice a week. \n You need to prepare yourself for the eventuality that your relationship will not be in this upswing forever. You need to know how to handle yourself during dry spells. You probably feel like my saying this is insulting your intelligence\u2014but from her perspective, you already blew it once, and it isn\u2019t too far of a stretch to think it could happen again. \n I want you to succeed in this. My now-husband and I have a wonderful, incredibly strong relationship, in part because our \u201cincident\u201d taught us how to communicate better. Forgiveness is a beautiful part of humanity. But while I have entirely forgiven, I have not (obviously) forgotten. And I suspect your girlfriend never will, either. You just have to make sure she trusts you enough that she doesn\u2019t let this incident color the rest of your relationship (whether its a couple months or sixty years), and part of that is sucking it up and letting her read your texts until she feels she no longer has to. \n ", "features": ["phrases related to legal matters and sports injuries", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "phrases related to conflicts, injustices, and tragedies", "phrases related to decision-making or judgment", "phrases related to expressing doubt or uncertainty", "phrases related to expressing strong opinions or directives", "phrases related to informing or recounting events"], "feature_ids": [19, 14, 25, 30, 90, 607, 36], "scores": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.99]}

{"text": "Im currently [a D3 ADC main]( and the following is my opinion on the changes. \n \n I think double lifesteal builds will become more popular. Every single lifesteal item had its lifesteal values nerfed. People like C9 Sneaky already frequently use double lifesteal, this new patch just solidifies the idea. \n \n I would keep an eye on Caitlyn this patch since she will be able to have more presence after her powerful early game due to the attack speed buffs. Twitch is getting nerfed this patch which I feel takes him down a notch on the tier list. His Q, which was already a fairly weak escape compared to most ADs, takes way too long to charge up to make it a real escape now. All in all though, I think picks will remain generally the same..Though we may see the return of some hypercarries since most of them benefit greatly from attack speed which is getting buffed. Corki and Lucian will be very strong picks in my opinion since they both can effectively use the double lifesteal build(BT -> Triforce -> LW -> BOTRK). Note that ADCs that build BOTRK first will likely not build double lifesteal. \n \n Not really in my opinion. Mana isnt a very big concern lategame for ADCs typically, so this would be a early game item, however, the stats it provides VS getting something like a bloodthirster isnt worthwhile. I dont know, this item just feels so underwhelming in my opinion though. Its a completely sustain based item that doesnt provide as much damage as other items. \n \n People are overestimating the bloodthirster change. Its a nerf. The shield is actually really small, much smaller than I think people are imagining. I think that what will happen this patch is that double lifesteal builds will be very common, which means a decrease in damage due to lack of IE..however, the buffed attack speed makes up for it slightly. Ive only played a little on PBE and Im very 50/50 on these changes. \n \n \n Edit : Here are my thoughts on  Ezreal  as well, since hes my favorite champion and this thread is hyping him up a lot. \n He still has the same problems as before. If youre running the typical mana-adc setup(which is basically a standard ADC page with 4 mana regen glyphs in place of MR), you dont actually have that many mana issues in lane unless youre spamming. The item does help him mid-late game since hes actively using his spells in that time, but even so, building this early sets your damage extremely far back. As for Blue Build Ezreal, it has a chance of coming back, but the problem is that blue build Ezreal is even worse of a laner than the standard Ezreal lane. This means the enemy ADC can either bully you so hard that you dont have time to scale, or a pick a hypercarry with a free lane. \n Edit#2 :  Kogmaw  this time. \n Kogmaw is definitely was buffed in this patch. His standard build as of now(BOTRK->Triforce->LW->IE) got buffed really heavily. Attack speed as a whole was buffed, therefore Kogmaw does a lot more damage. BOTRKs passive damage was buffed, but its active was nerfed. IE was given more flat AD, which isnt huge on Kogmaw but everything helps. All in all, Kogmaw will be doing insane damage but hell require a team that can peel for him. \n ", "features": ["names of individuals", "phrases related to legal matters and sports injuries", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "names of sports teams and players", "phrases related to restaurants and food chains", "phrases related to international relations or policies"], "feature_ids": [2, 19, 14, 18, 20, 4], "scores": [0.02, -0.01, -0.01, 0.01, -0.01, -0.01]}

{"text": "I agree that IE is superior than BT now, but rushing it usually means either grabbing double dorans or a vamp scepter beforehand. It is completely possible that IE rush will be the norm now due to the increased AD on it. Unfortunately, you have to look at the survivability of ADCs in the current meta. I say double lifesteal will be popular over building IE because of the strength of bruisers. Plus people have already been using double lifesteal, so if IE does become common, it may take a bit longer for it to set in. I think the itemization choices of ADC depends on the enemy composition now, because if you dont need the survivability, you can forgo getting double lifesteal and get IE instead. \n ", "features": ["names of individuals", "phrases related to legal matters and sports injuries", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "phrases related to decision-making or judgment", "phrases related to expressing doubt or uncertainty", "phrases related to informing or recounting events", "comparisons or contrasts", "phrases related to expressing personal opinions or perspectives", "phrases related to technical and contractual information"], "feature_ids": [2, 19, 14, 30, 90, 36, 37, 281, 185], "scores": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.98, 0.98]}

{"text": "I was a season 3 Diamond 2 ADC and am currently Diamond 4 (havent played much this season) \n Proof: \n I have played 50-100 games on the PBE with these changes and hope i can provide some insight. As a disclaimer these may be totally off what will actually happen due to meta changes, etc. These are my opinion, however, from watching ADC pros my thoughts seem to coincide with theirs. \n \n Double Dorans into IE seems to be the most common as well as most potent build at the moment. Especially since attack speed is getting buffed pretty significantly. More attacks and more crit chance means more dmg overall. Botrk/Triforce builds seem okay as well. In general, think Season 2 style itemization. \n \n Caitlyn, Jinx, KogMaw, Trist seem to be the strongest from my testing but keep in mind this is my opinion and meta changes will also change what people pick. Playable tier seems to be Corki, Ezreal, Lucian, Twitch, Vayne. \n \n The new item is not very good at all. It wont replace any item you need to build so wouldnt even consider it on any ADC other than maybe Blue Build Ezreal. Look to build the new item in other roles! \n \n Do not rush Bloodthirster, it is infinitely better to rush IE. Triforce rush seems okay as well. Think of Bloodthirster as a defensive item before your defensive item if that makes sense. It might be better to get Zeal before Greaves due to the cost changes on both items. Scimintar is very strong as well. Will probably see this over Banshees in most cases now. \n \n \n I also think it is important to mention that healing/shielding supports will probably be a lot more popular with the new support item. 25% attack speed for 6 seconds with no internal cooldown is pretty nice and its pretty cheap. Also, Scimintar will be a much better choice also due to the massive price increase on Crucible. \n Despite what other people have posted I think double lifesteal builds arent good and will only get worse with this patch. Just makes even less since with lifesteal getting nerfed, becoming more expensive, and doing less dmg than an IE build in nearly every scenario. However, BT as a defensive item might be a viable choice. \n I think the ADC role will be more snowball and carrying then it is now. You will have less starts to keep you alive early but autoattacking dmg will be at an all time high and spike much sooner than in the past. These changes are both buffs and nerfs. Overall, I think theyre buffs in every way except staying alive early/mid game. \n Like I have mentioned before this is all my opinion, I have done some math on these changes and think what I listed will hold true. If you have any questions feel free to ask and I will try and get to them when I can. If you disagree thats fine, no reason to freak out :P just wait it out and see what the pros build (which Ill be doing as well). \n ", "features": ["phrases related to legal or formal statements", "phrases related to sports events and team news", "phrases related to business and organizational positions", "phrases related to technical specifications and features", "phrases related to news articles and journalism"], "feature_ids": [745, 109, 323, 300, 718], "scores": [-0.99, 0.01, 0.01, 0.99, 0.99]}

{"text": "I cant take full credit for this idea (just most of it), since the germ of it started  with this forum post , but one possible nudge event for Dark Lady Granger might take place in her second year. \n Even if we take the original threads premise that there are no Horcruxes, Tom Riddles Diary may well still be a parasitic magical artifact that contains his mind-state upload. (It makes sense for Tom --- obsessed as he is with not dying --- to create a self-restoring backup of himself, though he only made one, because it was not a very satisfying solution: it would be only a copy of him that gets restored, after all.) \n Said backup still ends up in the hands of Lucius Malfoy, the conflict between him and Arthur Weasley still takes place, and Ginny Weasley still gets the Diary. Animals, ghosts, and students are petrified. \n Hermione, lonely and bitter though she might be, begins her own investigation, because, someone or something is hunting people  just like her , and nobody seems to be doing anything about it. She may not be a Parselmouth, but one of the consequences of having no human friends is that she has become friends with Moaning Myrtle. With Myrtles testimony and possibly other help, Hermione solves the mystery in the beginning of May, only to get Petrified on her way to inform the teachers. \n She is awakened a month later, to learn that Dumbledore has been removed, Hagrid imprisoned, and Ginny (or someone else, if Diary had jumped) has vanished in the Chamber. She tells a teacher (or Pomfrey) about the basilisk and the location of the entrance to the Chamber (deduced thanks to Myrtle), but they do not have a Parselmouth who can open the Chamber, so they are unable to save Ginny or whomever might have the Diary at that point (though it is possibly too late by then, anyway), even though Dumbledore and Aurors are able to capture or kill Tom Riddle on his way out. (If captured alive, he is quickly executed, since nobody --- including the likes of Lucius Malfoy --- actually wants him around.) \n Dumbledore is able to pressure Lucius to resign from the Board of Governors, but Dumbledores own position is highly precarious (because a student  did  die on his watch), and nothing more can be done against Lucius. \n Hermione gets credit for solving the mystery, and she gets her Award for Special Services and her fifteen minutes of fame. Suddenly, everybody wants to be her friend (except for the Slytherins), and she even gets to hear nice things from people like Ron, like Seems like youre a real Gryffindor after all! \n However, she also learns that Hagrid did not survive his stay in Azkaban. \n It could be that the gentle giants heart was not as resilient in the face of the Dementors as one might have expected (with him being in his mid sixties, and who knows what the life expectancy for half-giants is?), or it could be that an overzealous Dementor (and a hostile or negligent warden) got him Kissed. Either way, he has been killed --- or, worse, desouled. \n With Hagrid being a relative nobody, a penniless, wandless, uncouth half-giant who wasnt that great a wizard even before he was expelled, and with Dumbledores position being precarious enough as it is, there is nobody to push for justice, especially since the orders to put him in Azkaban had come directly from Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge. \n Hermione is horrified, but she does not find a receptive audience in her campaign to get justice. Rather, she encounters indifference and thinly-veiled racism and classism (because something like that could never happen to a  proper  wizard or witch), victim blaming (because its Hagrids own fault for messing around with dangerous creatures, drawing suspicion to himself), and general cynicism and a sense of helplessness. Dumbledore, in particular, deeply regrets what had happened, but he knows that if he pushes for more accountability in the fiasco, he is going to be caught up in it as well, so he chooses the lesser evil and keeps his head down. (Not, incidentally, Greater Good. Thats Fanon. Dumbledore  rejected  Greater Good. Thats why he broke up with Grindelwald.) \n Hermione cant let it go, though, and, soon enough, everybody who suddenly wanted to be her friend no longer does. Even the Gryiffindors, who agree with her in principle and in House solidarity with herself and Hagrid, dont see what can be done, and they dont like to be reminded of it. \n Hermione is, once again, alone. She can accept that a tragic mistake had been made, but lack of consequences for Fudge or Malfoy and the general indifference tell her that the wizarding society in general and the Ministry in particular cannot be salvaged by working within the system. It is dead to her. Even that paragon of all that is good and right, Dumbledore --- the wizard who is a big part of why she had asked the Sorting Hat to put her into Gryffindor over Ravenclaw or Slytherin --- is, for all his magical capabilities and righteousness, unable to act within the law and unwilling to act outside of it. He and his teachings are dead to her as well. \n Thus it begins. Hagrid  will  get justice. All those oppressed and neglected, be they Muggleborn, Muggle, Squib, house-elf, centaur, werewolf, goblin, or not 100% human,  will  get justice.

{"text": "> The problem still exists though in resource extraction and the massive capital intensive nature of production on any meaningful scale with these things.

Youre quite right to say that resource extraction is problem at the global scale (to deny this would be naive), but to be fair, this is not the task of an engineer/developer/designer/architect at the local end of the same scale. The main point of p2p production for anti-capitalism is that it avoids reproducing the conditions of exploitation at the level of a developmental protocol. Its also a method for collaborative manufacture that relinquishes hierarchic and highly-centralised paradigms of production.

{"text": "I met my first real girlfriend online. We were friends for a couple years, having met by posting on a bands forum frequently. We eventually decided that we liked each other enough to be in a relationship. At that time I was six or so months away from turning 18 when we started dating, so when school got out that year I was technically old enough to make my own decisions. I decided to go visit her without telling my parents that I met her online, and, as you can imagine, they werent very pleased. I had already bought the plane ticket a few months in advance, though. Luckily, my parents were nice enough to not kick stupid teenage me out of the house. \n So summer comes around and I fly out to stay at a hotel in her town for about 10 days. My dad had some time to cool off by this point because he talked to her mom over the phone. For some reason her mom was okay with my visiting. \n I got on my very first plane to go see this girl. If I wasnt scared enough meeting someone Id been in love with for the first time, I had plenty of first-time-flyer adrenaline pumping through my veins. I somehow survived the layover and made it to the airport. From the airport, I took a 90-minute bus ride to a town near hers. She and her mom are to pick me up at the station, so I text her and let her know that Im there. It felt like days waiting for her to get there, although in reality it was probably only a few minutes. Every time the door opened or someone walked by, I looked up to see who it was. Finally the door opened and it was her. \n She walked in with a ribbon in her hair, even more beautiful than the photos she sent. Not at all a Catfish. Nervous as hell and somewhat shaky, we both hugged and were finally together. We held clammy hands and walked out to her moms car. \n The next 10 days were probably the best Ill ever experience. Carnivals, kites, ice cream, beaches. And this was on top of that kind of love you can only feel when youre 18 and havent been broken down by relationships and the real world yet. It was heaven. \n I returned the following year and had a blast. We were just as happy, and we continued chatting online every day when we were apart. \n The third summer, something prevented us from visiting each other. I dont remember what. By Fall, something had gone wrong. She became harder to reach, and our late night chats turned into sometimes-chats. I knew something was up. We had been together about three years. At some point she broke up with me over text message and wouldnt respond to my texts or calls. Just *poof* gone, done. \n It killed me. I felt the exact opposite of the way I felt during those days we were together. I was still madly in love with her, but she was nowhere to be found. I had no closure, even. The distance prevented me from going to her house, but I did try. I made plans with a friend to drive over 1000 miles during Spring break to see her. The day we were supposed to leave it snowed like crazy. Major highways along our route were shut down completely. Going around the areas that were covered in snow would have doubled our driving time.  We had to call it off. \n It took her over a year to finally send me an email apologizing and vaguely telling me why she left, but it was so vague that to this day I couldnt tell you the exact reason. I never really pressed too much because I didnt want to pull a Rob Gordon. \n Currently were on good terms. That is to say were friends on Facebook and email each other occasionally. I tried to be mature about it and accept her apology and remain on good terms. I dont like making enemies, and I just couldnt with someone I loved that much. \n tl:dr:  This is probably too long and detailed for anyone to read, but thats how my online relationship went. It was amazing, and she was everything I was expecting and more. But eventually I guess the long distance thing became too difficult for her, and she disappeared. Were Facebook friends now and both in new relationships, but Id be lying if I said I dont still think about her sometimes when I see a ferris wheel or a kite or hear our song or when Im getting too happy and my brain gets mad and clotheslines me. \n", "features": ["names of individuals", "phrases related to online activities and financial transactions", "phrases related to time and temporal concepts"], "feature_ids": [2, 506, 305], "scores": [0.98, 0.92, 0.85]}

{"text": "You can (and other commenters have) make an argument that killing bad people is a good thing, and from there argue that Dexter is LG, but that seems dodgy to me. No one thinks that Batman is less good because he doesnt kill the bad guys, for example. And if thats reconcilable because incapacitating is preferable to killing, then Dexter is being evil when he kills criminals that the police are just about to catch. \n Personally, I think alignment makes the most sense when used as a system to describe  motivations , not actions. Batman is good because he seeks the good of others at his own cost, extra good because he even seeks the good of people who dont deserve it (by not killing them), and lawful because he strictly follows a code. \n Characters dont change alignment because their well-intended actions have bad consequences, so alignment isnt about consequence. Good and evil characters can come up with the same solution (action) to different problems (motivations), so it cant just be about actions. \n OK, so alignment is about motivation. If we take that as given, then Dexter is clearly Lawful Evil. \n His killing is primarily motivated not by his sense of justice but by his bloodlust, which is an evil motivation. He kills for the sake of killing, and he relishes and glorifies it. You can see this pretty clearly by a thought experiment: if you took away Dexters code, he would kill indiscriminately and obviously be evil. If you took away his bloodlust/drive-to-kill/psychopathy/mental illness/whatever, he wouldnt kill, even though his code allowed for it, and he would probably be good. \n If we allow ourselves some recursion, we might consider that his code itself is a good-aligned motivation, but I dont agree. His motivation for following the code is largely about self-preservation - if he follows the code, he wont get caught. Secondarily his code is about his respect for his father, but I would be skeptical if you said he loved his father. Any sense of justice or vigilantism is only a tertiary motivation here, from my impression of the character. In fact, I think his sense of justice/revenge is really only a justification, and not a motivation at all. It allows him to live with himself to some degree, but doesnt actually factor in to his decision to kill (most of the time). \n Hes clearly Lawful on that dimension - his code is motivationally huge, hes legally minded rather than free-spirited, and lives under the laws of his society even if he doesnt follow them (if that makes sense). \n For me, the real tripping point is his relationships with Debra, Rita and Harrison, which I think are the most good-aligned parts of his life. Id personally like to chalk this up to the limitations of the alignment system - evil characters arent all evil about everything. \n I mean, really evil is just a label we put on things that upset our natural sense of justice; its not a particularly strictly defined term, and alignment is really only a first-order summation of motivation anyway. But Id take issue with (and probably wouldnt like to live with) someone who thought Dexter was good. \n ", "features": ["names of individuals", "phrases related to legal matters and sports injuries", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "names of individuals or specific entities", "phrases related to decision-making or judgment", "phrases related to expressing doubt or uncertainty", "phrases related to political events and key officials", "phrases related to expressing strong opinions or directives"], "feature_ids": [2, 19, 14, 27, 30, 90, 96, 607], "scores": [0.02, 0.01, 0.04, 0.42, 0.31, 0.11, 0.02, 0.51]}

The only problem could be that they ran at a very high pace which couldve contributed to some defensive woes but even then they had a great Net Rating (as baskref defines: an estimate of point differential per 100 possessions). \n So no, I dont think its very mature to blame McHale here (especially during the season). \n During the playoffs however... \n The Rockets only went 7 deep... McHale started Terrence Jones for 2 games because well, he didnt have an answer for LaMarcus (even when LaMarcus cooled off for a little bit in the series, he was still a major focus for McHale, and he couldnt prevent the Blazer ball from moving through LA). \n Dwight Howard was a beast (26 and 13) and James Harden was just very human... or terrible...

Ive seen some research journals and doctors postulating that upregulating one neurotranmitter (serotonin with SSRIs), will deplete others because of brain regulating functions. when brain sees a rise in one neurtransmitter, it might try to upregulate mono-amine oxidase to bring it down, and monoamine oxidase effects all neurotransmitters throughout the body. \n \n the stigma attached. a whole bunch of people are blissfully unaware and uneducated about what mental illness is and isnt. people scoff at others for needing a pill to maintain their happiness, among other stupid shit. Ive read once about a girl who was worried her boyfriend would break up with her because he flipped his shit when he learned she was taking prozac (i dont know if im dating you or the drug). \n \n benzodizaphines--xanax, ativan, and other anti-anxiety drugs--are used by people recreationally and they develop crippling dependence and tolerance for them. with that in mind, consider the case for those anxiety sufferers whos sanity hinges on those .5mg tablets. if you dont have a psychiatrist whos on top of your case and brings his best game, you can be in worse a situation than where he left you. you can also kill yourself with xanax with consumed with excess alcohol. \n \n if you start any of these drugs, you have to be very careful about coming off of them and must do so with doctor instruction. google antidepressant withdrawal for more, but expect brain zaps and seizures if you dont. \n \n which brings me to my next point. psychiatrist themselves can suck ass. 15 minute appointments are typical even when youre experiencing something so debilitating and serious. I also hear you have to be very assertive about side effect concerns otherwise theyll just take everything as going swimmingly and increase your dosage. but this isnt exclusive to psych docs. general practitioners and others can be just as bad about treating patients as numbers in a system which they dispense drugs to. \n \n \n This is a kind of pessimistic view where psychiatry is at right now. But there are some very promising things to come for the field. Ive been told by my psych doctor that more genetic testing and targeted anti-depressant therapies are in the works which minimal to zero side effect profiles. Whereas anti-depressant kind of worked by throwing a wrench in the system, newer treatments ive seen actually make use of the bodys own processes. \n youd be surprised just how much of a difference in mental health can be made just by supplementing the body with more of those amino acids and co-factors necessary for the creation of neurotransmitters, rather than introducing a new foreign chemical to the mix. \n i see an integrative psych (who has an MD, and has taught at UCLA, if youre worried about credentials) who ive seen prescribe some of these to her patients: \n \n tryptophan / 5htp (i suggest 5htp) - acts on serotonin and is an analog to your typical ssri (but absolutely do not take in combination). Ive seen it theorized that excess endogenous 5-ht in the blood can eventually lead to heart valve scarring in the long run, but SSRIs cause that too and there has never been any research study explicitly linking 5-htp with this adverse outcome. hell, you might even say its protective of the heart because of the stress relief and calming effect adequate serotonin balance has. \n \n tyrosine - acts on dopamine, but might be shoddy in effect. \n \n b vitamins l-methylcobalmin  and l-methylfolate  - these are vitamins b9 and b12 (atleast i think?). these natrually occuring in your body and are very powerful supplements. these are not the typical useless b vitamin shit you might fight at your local health food store. The difference is that these are actually bio-available/immediately usable by the body. l-methylcobalmin ive seen come over the counter in sub-lingual form, or by subcutaneous injection (has stronger and consistent effect) by prescription.  L-methyfolate comes in typical pill form (google drug called deplin). If you know anything about SAM-E, these are kind of involved in the same mechanism. It turns out a lot of people have fucked up [methylation processes]( , of which neurotransmitter among 500 other things, are involved. Id say its similar to how one can have hypothyroidism and how that can affect brain chemistry. \n \n vitamin d3. everyone is usually pretty deficient and can benefit from taking 1k-5k IUs a day. fun fact: vitamin D is so vital that it acts more like a hormone than a vitamin. \n \n l theanine - an analog to your typical benzodiazaphine. acts on gaba. however, it is infinitely safer, comes with zero side effects, and can be taken in insane doses without adverse effects. therapeutic dose is 200ish mg, fda max reccomended is 1200mg, but ive seen rat studies where they fed them 1000 mgs per body weight with no noticeable effects. \n \n there a whole lot of others, like trace minerals, phospdatyltyserine (aka PS, and this spelling is really wrong), magnesium, omega 3s. \n \n \n ", "features": ["mentions of the color red", "phrases related to showcasing or demonstrating something", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "proper nouns related to various topics", "phrases related to legal matters and sports injuries", "phrases related to restaurants and food chains", "information related to the German language", "references to political inquiries or investigations", "phrases related to direction and movement"], "feature_ids": [3, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], "scores": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]}

{"text": "Let me try! Okay, so wrestling. yes, its fake! Sort of. The athleticism is very, very real. The outcomes and plotlines are scripted, absolutely. So are what are called spots. Spots are any planned action or series of actions in a match. Heres a good example of an exciting spot: [Shawn Michaels gives Shelton Benjamin the Sweet Chin Music]( One interesting thing about wrestling, however, that isnt well known is the amount of improv that is done in-ring. The best wrestlers are respected as ring generals who employ ring psychology. Ring Generals are experienced wrestlers who know how to work a match to its full potential. Ring psychology is the science of wrestling a match in such a way that the crowd becomes emotionally involved in the show. Good acting skills and a sense of dramatic timing are important to this. This takes legitimate skill and talent! \n Now, most new people make the mistake of going into wrestling thinking of it as a fake sport. Its NOT a fake sport. Its a drama! It has athletic activity regularly, but the emphasis is 50/50 with the story. Its flashy, sometimes cheesy, sometimes very serious. Some of the time wrestling doesnt take itself seriously one bit, playing on the fact that its not real. Kayfabe, or pretending its all real, essentially, is often tongue-in-cheek. The crowd and fans are not stupid; they know its just as much scripted as your favorite movie is. The difference is that the wrestlers actually endure quite a lot of pain. Personally, I respect the hell out of what they do. Theyre on the road 300+ days a year, beating the hell out of themselves for the audiences enjoyment. One of my favorite matches to introduce people into the world of wrestling is between Kurt Angle and Shane McMahon. In the match, Kurt Angle was wrestling for his third time that evening, with a concussion. He breaks his tailbone midmatch, and Shane McMahon is knocked out, all legitimately, or not kayfabe injuries. They both finish the match and its incredible to see a show of respect from 40k people all at once as they cheer for what they just witnessed. \n Some of the wrestlers are actually VERY good at what is called a promo, or an in-character interview or monologue. One wrestler, Mick Foley is known for being incredible on the microphone, and there is one promo in particular that always generated emotion in me. In the kayfabe, Mick Foley was being called a coward by the new guy Randy Orton after backing out of a match. Randy spit on his face in a previous week, and Mick Foley called out Randy to ask him to do it again. Its VERY well acted, please check it out if you have 5 minutes. Or if you have 25, watch the whole promo! I wont spoil the climax, but its worthy of respect. \n As for the reason people care about the outcomes of matches... You tend to enjoy certain wrestlers for the athletic ability, their passion for working the crowd, their dedication, and their specific moves and skills, their charisma. Giving them championship wins may be scripted, but its basically the company saying Youre the face of our company now, youre the top. We respect you this much to put you here and give you the chance to become a star. People want their favorites to get that respect. Its definitely satisfying. Its satisfying like it is when you watch a good drama on TV and the end of the season gives you goosebumps.

{"text": "Id extrapolate the future by analyzing the past, but only so far. \n Fifty years ago--in 1964--is when Marvel really became popular. Up until then, it was DC that dominated the comic book industry. By this time, Batman and Superman had been kickin ass and takin names for thirty years. In 64, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had already started their  anno miribilis  a year before, kicking out Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, and the Avengers, among others. So at this time, most of our favorite Marvel superheroes had come into being. \n The staples are now Spider-Man, the X-Men and the Avengers (the Fantastic Four seem to have quietly slunk to the back as the others take the spotlight). I think the heroes are inevitably defined by their villains, and the reason why these heroes are so popular is because they have so many memorable villains, such as Magneto (whom most of us can identify with). Another reason is that the success of the comic book heroes and their cinematic counterparts (the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as its called) are becoming more intertwined. Disney, with its purchase of Marvel, wants to tie-in everything. \n So where are we heading in fifty years? Thats a doozy...the way things are changing with the world now, its no  guarantee  people will be reading comics ( as we know them ) fifty years from now. But in the next ten years or so, you can assume the X-Men, Spider Man, and the Avengers will continue to assert their popularity. If I had to guess which one would fall behind in popularity, Id guess Spider-Man, and this is a direct result of ownership issues--Sony currently owns the cinematic rights to Spider-Man, and thats going to result in him being excluded from the nascent MCU. So around 20 years from now, the kids who grew up with the MCU will look back fondly on the X-Men and the Avengers the way we look back fondly on the early days of Lee and Kirbys work. \n If I had to guess, the Fantastic Four could make a comeback. I believe theyre getting a remake in the MCU. The Hulk may find a resurgence of popularity, although Marvel had a tough time making the Hulk an attractive franchise on-screen. Another problem is Marvels tendency to humanize villains to such an extent that they become good and thus were running out of villains to love/hate. Emma Frost is a good example of this. I think this needs to stop if the franchise is going to go forward. \n Another thing to consider is the appearance of new characters. These seem to come in bunches. The most memorable I can think of is the reinvigorated X-Men franchise in the mid-70s. The X-Men never initially took off, and was considered one of Stan Lees  misses.  By the mid-70s, they were out of production until they were revived by a little-known English writer named Chris Claremont. Claremont and a couple others realized the X-Men needed to have more adult elements to them (they were initially teens) and become more varied. Thus they added the German Nightcrawler, the Russian Colossus, the Canadian Wolverine, and Shadowcat, Dazzler,Storm, Rogue, and a bunch of others. This was a smashing success, and under Claremont the X-Men became Marvels flagship franchise. Again in the late 80s/early90s a whole batch of new characters were introduced, including Gambit. Were overdue a wave of new characters who take the world (and our attention) by storm. \n ", "features": ["names of individuals", "names of sports teams and players", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "phrases related to international relations or policies", "phrases related to showcasing or demonstrating something", "phrases related to conflicts, injustices, and tragedies", "phrases related to decision-making or judgment"], "feature_ids": [2, 18, 14, 4, 13, 25, 30], "scores": [0.22, 0.0, 0.14, 0.0, 0.44, 0.26, 0.38]}

I actually think Darjeeling has both his best and worse work in it (although I seriously loved Budapest, more on that later). His first few films (which I also love) are more concerned with creating a story that fits the style he created. What I think Darjeeling did differently, was to grapple with issues that were apart from the style. As though there was a force outside the movie that imposes itself. That force is death. It is powerful and IMHO struggling with that through ones work is a hallmark of a work worth considering. SPOILER ALERT: the movie is its best once they get thrown off the train to when they leave the village. Including the flashback. The film takes a serious nosedive into shit after that. That middle chunk of the film is an astonishingly adult moment from a filmmaker who had seemed to only flirt with these emotions previously (see Royals cancer and Zissous friend as the actual narratives at work.

{"text": "More (professional) images here: \n From Wikipedia: \n 118 Wallypower is a 118-foot (36 m) luxury motor yacht with a maximum speed of 60 knots (70 mph, 110 km/h) produced by Wally Yachts.[1] The yacht is narrow and angular in design with black glass housing, driven by three Vericor TF50 gas turbines generating 5,600 horsepower (4,200 kW), each driving a Rolls-Royce Kamewa water jet, two steerable outboard and a non-steering booster on the centerline. The steerable water jets also have a diesel engine input for a 370 hp (280 kW) Cummins diesel, thus making the ship a Combined Diesel or Gas Turbine (CODOG) configured vessel. The total power output is 16,800 horsepower (12,500 kW). One 118 WallyPower has been constructed and it is owned by the Kondakji family.[2] \n Construction \n The hull of the 118 WallyPower is the result of an extensive R&D program including tank testing at the SSPA facility in Gothenburg, Sweden, and smoke testing in the Ferrari Wind Tunnel Facility in Maranello, Italy. It is stable at speed as a result of the deep V (22 degrees) hull shape and a straight stem bow designed to pierce waves. \n The air inlets of the gas turbines were optimised to minimise any turbulence and back flow of the exhaust gas on deck and living areas. The bottom of the hull is solid fibreglass. Topsides, from the waterline up, are hybrid fibreglass/carbon composite with balsa core. The deck is a Nomex/full carbon composite. The deck superstructure is made of a carbon frame to which glass panels are glued. The glass is composed of Lexan and a triple laminate of glass. The interior bulkheads and cabin soles carry no structural loads, so they are made of thin wood and laminate veneer skins with cores. The bath fixtures and dining tables are made from carbon composites to reduce weight. \n The paint finish is metallic dark green, and changes reflections and colour depending on the light and landscape. The 118s deck, cockpit, navigation, dining and saloon areas have been designed as one continuous element. The open space incorporates three areas, from stern to bow: the saloon, the dining/seating area, and the navigation cockpit. There is a 360-degree view from the dining area. Underneath the 8-place dining table is a skylight which illuminates the lower corridor. The dining and lounge cockpit is forward of the superstructure for privacy, and away from the heat of engines. Two fore dining tables can be mechanically lowered into place in the bow. The deck of the Wally 118 has a hidden crane and compartment for a tender. The boat also features 6 plasma screen TVs. \n Inside, the owner\u2019s stateroom is forward, lighted by a top skylight, and has a king-size bed and side cabinets and his and hers en-suite bathrooms. Two identical guest cabins have queen-size beds and en-suite bathrooms. The stainless steel galley (kitchen), which includes the crew mess, has an oven, stove, television, and refrigerators. \n Technical specifications \n The price of the 118 Wallypower is US$33 million for the triple gas turbine version, or $22 million for twin diesels. It has a range of 1,500 nautical miles (2,800 km) at 9 knots (17 km/h), or 300 nautical miles (560 km) at 60 knots (110 km/h). Fuel capacity is 22,000 liters (5800 US gallons). At the maximum speed of 60 knots (110 km/h) the gas turbine uses 15 US gallons / 58 liters of fuel per nautical mile, 900 gallons / 3500 liters per hour. The boat displaces only 95 tons because of the sophisticated building technology that uses a hybrid structure to save weight, and can accommodate six guests and six crew. \n Awards \n The 118 WallyPower won the MYDA, Millennium Yacht Design Award,[3] organised by Seatec (the yachting and shipping technology show of Carrarafiere) for the Layout of the Third Millennium. It was the sole boat in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art architecture and design exhibition (2004/5), Glamour: Fabricating Affluence.[4] \n Popular culture \n The 118 WallyPower has appeared in popular UK car programme Top Gear - where it was compared with a Pagani Zonda S Roadster[5] - as well as the movie The Island. \n ", "features": ["names of individuals", "locations or geographic regions", "terms related to law enforcement and legal actions", "information related to governmental policies and international affairs", "phrases related to showcasing or demonstrating something", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "proper nouns related to various topics", "financial terms related to investments and trade", "names of sports teams and players"], "feature_ids": [2, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18], "scores": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]}

{"text": "From a purely technical viewpoint its important that the reader knows what kind of book theyre reading. Im currently reading Dresden Files myself and Jim Butcher had some very subtle, but well placed hints on what the world is like in the story. Think about the flyers in Dresdens office. We are subtly told a mass of things simply by being told there are flyers there: 1) Dresden has written them himself. In other words, he personally believes in these things, 2) Not everyone is aware of the information, hence the need for the flyers, 3) The titles were given in the flyers serve as a subtle hint to the basic elements of the story. Were left to imagine what magic and you means, but we can make a pretty good guess. It also piques our interest and invites us to read more. \n Hints can be stray mentions to something that isnt explained yet to the reader, items like the flyers, or parts of inner monologue, just to name a few. Jim Butcher lets Dresden tell us with very clear words right from the start who he is and what he does, but doesnt go on to show us vampires or magic straight away (not in the first book at least).

{"text": "Medieval 2: Teutonic campaign as the titular Crusaders \n Lithuania was losing the war.  Badly.  Then, in a backroom deal from hell they allied with the novgorodians and the danes prompting a huge invasion of the north.  Despite this, Lithuania was still losing ground, so they sent the majority of their forces deep into my territory to try and capture a new home.  That poor city was defended by two groups of basic swordsmen and a unit of prussian archers and 40 clergymen.  The Lithuanian horde has hundreds of heavy cavalry and plenty of infantry.  I set the archers on the walls and the swords surrounding the gate.  The clergy have a role to play in this battle as well and they shall need all the faith they can muster; their job is to stand directly in the entryway to brake the cavalrys charge so the swords can charge in themselves. \n Now, I should mention that our little priest friends performed admirably, not only stopping the charge dead in its tracks but managing to kill a whopping six heavy cavalry (19/40 managed to recover post battle as well).  The true heroes wound up being the archers.  Not only did they slaughter hundreds with their arrows, but upon running out I had them join the melee below as a last ditch effort to hold the gate against an absurd number of horsemen. \n Its not every day you get to see archers charging cavalry but holy shit is it fun.  Those archers ended up killing some 600 people in that battle (and being awarded two whole experience for it) ensuring that the town would stay mine  forever  until the save corrupted and I wept bitterly. \n ", "features": ["names of individuals", "locations or geographic regions", "mentions of the color red", "phrases related to international relations or policies", "actions related to implementing bans and restrictions", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "proper nouns related to various topics", "phrases related to conflicts, injustices, and tragedies"], "feature_ids": [2, 7, 3, 4, 11, 14, 15, 25], "scores": [0.02, 0.82, 0.0, 0.14, 0.0, 0.12, 0.92, 0.86]}

{"text": "I like the idea, but just bear in mind that a tool is used for what its used for.  Basically; it almost doesnt matter what you want it to be used for, and what purpose you have in mind, because in the end people will use it however they want to, and if you dont want people to use it for a thing, theyll find a way.  Craigslist, for example, didnt start off a cruising site - Im not even sure if it had an interpersonal meetup thingy in the first place.  These things were added on over time because people kept sneaking this or that into various other threads, so they finally sorted it out. \n Once you put a thing into the world, its not your thing anymore.  Game console developers and Mac trying to block users and consumers from jail breaking their products are fighting a futile battle.  Sort of like the author is dead, except with tools. \n Having a name that better reflects the better intentions you have is definitely a key thing (I like Gentleman Caller as a name; have the app logo be a monocle, moustache, and tophat :P ), and having certain kinds of on-board functionality is also very important. \n A suggestion of mine is that when you block someone, which alas is inevitable, make sure theres  different kinds  of blocking.  So for example, some people block their friends so that awkward conversations are avoided.  Some people block others that arent their type and would rather just avoid awkward conversation and possible future hostilities and dont want to make a thing out of it.  Others are blocked because in the first 5 minutes it becomes obvious that youre interested in different things (a mature person would just say No, thanks and move on, but blocking is also a thing).  And of course, the intended purpose; blocking someone for hassling, aggression, hostility, or stalker-ly behaviour.  Each of these  means  something different, and each could have a different impact on things.  Blocking because you know someone or want to avoid a racy conversation would want some kind of amicable no harm, bro kind of blocking, whereas more stalker-y, mean, racist kinds of blocking should involve some kind of a [MeowMeowBeenz]( system where they go up or down and if you fall off the charts you get a message saying hey guy; why so hostile?. \n Of course a reputation system wouldnt need to be a complicated thing to implement; if the app is in Java or Python, its just another property you give to the class profile, or however its being done.  And the reputation needs to be a reputation  within a system , and getting a social networking side to it is also a piece of cake, so long as you understand the mathematical properties of Graph Theory (also levels; the universal network, the local/city network, and ones own directly associated network of up to two or three degrees).  If you do implement something like this,  do  include weights, plz?  So something like connectivity weight = 2 if youre friends IRL, a 1 if you do know each other, a 0.5 if you only know each other online and made friends through the app, and like a 0.75 if you made friends through the app but you chat frequently (something automatic; nobody updates things, or if they do, they do it obsessively then eventually quit the app because its taking up too much of their lives). \n Effect of reputation (i.e. whether or not a given person even shows up on your screen at all) would just be a factor of degrees of separation, by the weights of those connections, by some fudge factor that the user sets (so a high setting lets in more people regardless of network reputation, low setting lets in fewer people).  There could even be optional stuff, so like for every conversation where someone says... anything, really, and you never even respond, then you get like a -1 on the responsive dimension, which a user can choose to ignore - or filter.  Eventually, known creepo asshats fall out of the network, and charming friendly people become more available. \n I only just read about your app just now, and Im writing these ideas as fast as I can type without even pausing to think because these are things that Ive thought about for a long time because all of the existing apps annoy me in the same ways; \n \n all friends are dumped into the same pool, regardless of how friendly or close you are \n \n all blocks are dumped into the same pool, regardless of why you blocked them \n \n theres no real benefit from being a good person; theres no harm from being a douchenozzle, specifically; people who are kind enough to just say not interested, sorry get nothing for it and people who just flat out ignore you just roll on and the whole app ends up feeling just as cold and alienating as all the others \n \n effort and good manners are more punished than anything, and most gay apps are  very good at breeding bad behaviour \n \n \n If you do introduce a blocking system, also note that people will abuse it (again; see MeowMeowBeenz).

{"text": "In my opinion Thresh is currently in a fine spot after all the nerfs he has gotten. \n I understand the lantern nerf because the ability was designed to be a saving ability for only 1 person, it shouldnt shield the whole team. The thing I am mostly worried is, how will the shield choose the target? If you throw it in middle of 4 people will you randomly shield the wrong target? With this change though they should add more shield value since it is not that big at the moment. \n The box nerf I dont really understand. I have always liked the concept of the ability since you trap people inside there and you can hook or flay them back in if they are trying to escape.

For better or for worse, the industry usually acts like theres a wall between payers and non-payers, and everyone on the non-player side is irrelevant. There is some real wisdom to this, as there are some players who simply will never ever give you a dime, and there are some who will spend hundreds of dollars on basically anything. \n The focus on non-payers is only to  find  the payers within that group, and unlock their potential as payers. Most of the optimization, though, is focused on payers, and determining what they want to pay for.

{"text": "> leading a stellar academic career on the way to getting her doctorate \n Shes still in grad school then? What year is she in? Getting a PhD is very, very stressful, and in many fields exceptionally time consuming. The PhD students in our lab spend most of their day at work, weekends included, especially if they are in the trying to graduate stage. Im not going to presume to know her personality or how she feels, but I will hazard some guesses as a fellow mid 20s, female, research scientist. \n Its quite likely that while she is aware of the problem and undoubtedly bothered by it, the demands of grad school are far more pressuring. There may be too many other things to worry about right now that she perceives as far more important -- qualifiers (oral and written), writing a dissertation, defending said dissertation, getting published, conferences, next advisor meeting, committee meeting, and on and on. Like me, she may have pushed it to the back of her mind. It almost seems more stressful to deal with my face having so many blemishes than tackle the next experiment. I just dont have the time or energy to stress over it. Physical appearance really just does not take priority in the life of most grad students, especially in a hard science. Wed be more crazy than we already are. \n Wait until she offhand mentions it again and turn it into a conversation. Ask her what shes tried before, if anything. Depending on how much it affects her self-esteem, the mood shes in, all that fun stuff, she may cry. She may get negative and say none of it ever worked and demonstrate hopeless feelings. She may be more calm and say she just hasnt had the time to think about it. She may be worried about costs to see a dermatologist and prescriptions. You wont know what the roadblock is until you get her to talk about it. Prepare yourself for a number of reactions here. Depending on how it goes, you can express that youre there to support and help get her started if she would like to try. \n Your job is to be as supportive as possible. If she doesnt have the time to research and shop for products, dermatologists, etc, but is willing to try something if you set it up. Do it for her. She may do the research herself but need encouragement actually trying out products, prescriptions, etc and sticking with it. If its difficult to treat or doesnt clear up very fast, it can be very disappointing and more of a blow to self esteem than just ignoring the problem had been. If she doesnt want to deal with it right now, leave it alone. \n Depending on the type of acne, OTC topical treatment routines may not be enough to clear it. She may need a prescription topical or oral treatment, particularly if the acne is more hormonal related. Hormonal acne cant be treated by topicals (theyll just clear it up faster, but wont prevent breakouts), but there are oral treatment options like birth control or spironolactone. She would need to see a doctor for that. Depending on the state you live in, she might be able to try out PocketDerm online, which will get her a dermatologist consult AND prescription for $20/month. If a dermatologist is too costly or too hard to get in to see (or the medications are too costly), a general physician might be able to help some. Its also possible that the stress itself is contributing to her acne. \n /r/skincareaddiction has a lot of helpful information. Check out the sidebars, peruse the FAQ. Theres more information and reviews on PocketDerm there as well. Arm yourself with knowledge about whats out there so that if she comes back with any fears about cost, availability, options, whatever, you can help dissuade those fears. \n CAVEAT: You really ought to know where shes at in her degree plan before tackling this. You absolutely do NOT want to start a conversation over this if shes at a crucial, stressful point in her degree.

{"text": ">We dont need to print money in order to recover an investment that hasnt been repaid. \n But you already did print the money when you lent it, because you arent actually debiting a bank account to remove it. In the I, R, C situation, you printed $100. If that how every loan that isnt repaid goes, you will explosive inflation. \n >If you borrow $5 billion, $5 billion doesnt leave the bank. It just moves from one account to your account. \n Right. Account A -5b and Account B +5b. If account B spends his 5b on resources, Account C is now +5b and Account B is +0. A is still -5b. If B fails in their enterprise, account A is now out -5b. You can either take it from C, which would be separating C from the value of their labor, OR you can write off the -5b for A, which means you printed +5b. That is hyper inflationary. \n >I never said we are printing money to make any loans.\nMaking a loan is just transferring money from one account at the bank to another account at the bank. It does not require the printing of any money. \n I think it is important you read my above paragraph and address it. \n >Your production depends on how much labor you contribute. So you are paid based on how much labor you contribute. If you contribute more labor by working harder or longer, you will produce more and therefore get paid more. \n You said a worker benefits when you spend (rather than take) their money and invest it in another firm they own. If a firm that makes cars gets 3% more efficient, how does the worker who makes phones benefit? Either 1. the workers at the car factory make 3% more money/credits, which means phone worker was separated from the value of his labor and didnt actually benefit from his mandatory investment. Or, 2., cars are now 3% cheaper, which only benefits phone worker if A. he wants what car factory makes and B. the only metric of what a worker produced is simply hours worked, rather than a market value of the product (which Ive been told can still exist in socialism, correct me if mistaken). \n So phone worker only benefits from car factory investment if 1. Car factory workers democratically decide to make their product cheaper rather than claim increased productivity for themselves, 2. phone worker wants a car (could be any object or service really), and 3. the value a worker produces is measured in hours rather than a socialist marketplace. Otherwise, phone worker is being exploited, no? \n EDIT: In regard to the money printing, in Socialism its even worse than in capitalism! If money is actually pegged to labor hours, not only are you devaluing the work of every single worker in the bank, but you are also exploiting them. If A borrows 5 labor hours from the collective Bank, B, and trades those 5 labor hours for 5 hours of Cs labor for a product, C has received labor hours from A in exchange for Cs labor, but B is still owed 5 hours. If A cannot produce 5 labor hours of value, B must either simply write off As labor debt as if it never happened, which means every hour worked by anyone is a little bit less efficient due to the waste, or B must write off the 5 labor hours as lost, which means the other workers lost 5 labor hours in exchange for absolutely nothing, meaning they were exploited and separated from the value of their labor. \n IF I were a Socialist, I would mandate that the Bank charge an interest rate to maintain value, rather than make a profit. That way borrowers are paying for the privilege of taking others Labor in advance. Rates targeted at just covering costs of operation and the cost of failed enterprises ensures that workers are NOT exploited by having their labor value be destroyed, and workers seeking enterprise are paying for the cost of enterprises that fail and protecting the total value of labor hours. \n ", "features": ["mentions of the color red", "phrases related to international relations or policies", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "terms related to law enforcement and legal actions", "information related to governmental policies and international affairs", "phrases related to showcasing or demonstrating something", "proper nouns related to various topics", "phrases related to decision-making or judgment"], "feature_ids": [3, 4, 14, 9, 10, 13, 15, 30], "scores": [0.0, 0.0, 0.95, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.95]}

{"text": "I had a friend who went into business with another friend he had known for a while. They took over a vaporizer (vape/electronic cig) shop. Ill (try to) keep it short, but there was just a cluster of things. I dont know anything about running a business, so I might be wrong on some bits. \n They didnt rent/lease their own place or anything. They took over a shop. A not-doing-so-well one. It wasnt hard to see why. \n \n Location , location, location. The location wasnt all that great. A heavily Korean area, and the only reason to drive by the area were to get to 2 big brand stores. \n \n Unsurprisingly,  not many customers . Maybe several window shoppers, a couple of actual sales. We got maybe 1 sale over 50$ a week. We would get a sale over 100$ maybe once, max twice a month. Towards the end before the place closed, we were lucky to even see 50$ in a day. \n \n Too many employees  for starting out, or,  not enough money to pay  a fair wage. Started out with 4 people, usually working at once, at first, at below minimum wage. Under the table pay. One person left. Soon after, our wage was lowered to an insane amount per hour. Unemployed, even the meager amount for the stupid hours was better than literally nothing. \n \n The store was too big  for its purpose. A third of the shop went unused, and was eventually used as a break area. For some reason, this  vape  shop had  2  bathrooms. A single unisex, at most, would be fine. The shop was even bigger before! It was cut off for another, smaller shop. \n \n Along that line,  rent was /seemed  high . It wasnt uncommon for the profits for the month not even be able to pay the rent, let alone the employees. \n \n They went in not knowing  the shop had previous debt . How could you overlook this? My guess is that they were overly optimistic on how well this place would do and took on the debt, knowingly. \n \n All the money owed must have gone to  making the shop look pretty . Fancy broken glass in the displays ($2k), 4 loveseats and a couch,  4  flat screens, and lots of fake plants. \n \n Negligence from one owner . One of the two owners was a cool guy, but he started slipping once he saw the business wasnt doing so hot. He stopped coming in. He made flavors customers loved and came in for, but because he never showed up, they were never in supply. On top of that, this guy would constantly hook people up the few times he was in, so when people came in to pick up what they were promised, they specifically requested for him, for things the employees could easily do. But  no , it  has  to be him. It came down to people calling, and eventually not coming back. \n \n Finally,  money was handled poorly . Of course, buying anything for the shop (cleaning supplies, toilet paper, hand soap, etc) was reasonable.  But taking out money to go to the convenience store for a soda ? Its a miracle in itself theres 10$ in the cash register, why on earth would you take them out to get some snacks? It happened once... then a few times... then finally, it pretty much became a daily thing. 5 - 30$ a day. Money was taken out so the employees could use it for lunch. Considering how little was made, it was spending what they pretty much dont have. \n \n \n Phew!  I wanted to keep it short, but alas, my frustrations got the best of me. The shop was open a total of maybe a year, and closed sometime back in June of this year. \n ", "features": ["mentions of the color red", "phrases related to international relations or policies", "requests for instruction or help", "locations or geographic regions", "terms related to law enforcement and legal actions", "information related to governmental policies and international affairs", "actions related to implementing bans and restrictions"], "feature_ids": [3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11], "scores": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.83, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]}

{"text": "Ok heres a longer story but definitely the most WTF moment for me while tripping. \n So the day starts with my 2 friends and I each taking 2 hits of acid. For one of my friends and me this was out first time taking more than 1 tab. So we come up on the tabs, go for a walk, typical tripping stuff. \n So like 4 hours into the trip, we are back at my friends apartment. The day prior, I had left my jacket in another friends car and we had talked about meeting up so I could grab it. He was nice enough to offer to come to our place to drop it off. So he calls me when gets there and says Hey TheMagicFlight, Im here but their are a bunch of police in front of the apartment. I look out the window and see like 3 cop cars parked on the street. Now, I was tripping but I felt comfortable enough to just go outside and grab a jacket from my friend. Easy, right? \n WRONG! So I open the apartment door and walk down the stairs. I open the front door to the apartment complex (which you cannot see through) and the second I open it, BOOM! Im greeted by a drunk guy and 4 police officers. The drunk grabs me lightly and says Heeeey man, you got money?? The police officer puts his hand on my shoulder and says Do you know this guy? To which I immediately respond no and push his shoulder off me and walk past them. \n At this point all Im thinking is what the fucking fuck..... I walk out to the street as I watch all of the officers storm the apartment building. I grab the jacket from my friend and say thanks. I still have no clue what is going on but I didnt want to walk back in through the front door so I decided I would try the back door. I walk around the entire complex, up the back stairs and open the door to my friends place. I am immediately greeted but my 2 tripping friends screaming at me. WHAT THE FUCK THEMAGICFLIGHT, WHAT IS GOING ON,  WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO??? \n So this is where the story changes from my perspective to theirs. So right after I left the apartment earlier, the drunk guy had walked up the stairs and OPENED the front door to my friends apartment. My friends who are still tripping balls all think that this is my friend dropping off the jacket (They didnt know him). The drunk guy just walks into the apartment and walks right up to my friends. My friends (thinking that this is my friend dropping the jacket off) stand up to shake hands with him. Then the drunk mofo says Heeeey, you guys got $30 I can borrow? My friends then start to realize that this is not TheMagicFlights friend, but just some random drunk guy who just walked into their apartment!! At that moment my friends look towards the door and standing at the entrance to the door are all of the police officers just staring into the apartment. Keep in mind, we have 2 bongs, and oil rig, jars of weed (my friend was actually growing at the time), amphetamine, xanax, acid, molly all just chilling on my friends coffee table which is in plain view from the doorway. \n My friends ushered the drunkard out of the apartment and my friend says What is going on? Does that guy need help? to the officers who are just as useless as the drunk dude. They say sorry and then one of the officers says We got him, but maybe you should come with us too...  as some sort of joke (hysterical! Right?? No! )  They close the door and lock it. Thats when I walk in the back door. \n We watched them talking to this drunk guy for like another 45 minutes before they just let him go.... We still have no idea what the fuck happened. Now, I understand this story doesnt sound THAT crazy but trust me when I say this when this shit happens to you when you are tripping balls on acid for your first time, it was quite tramatic at the time. We did continue to trip and have a good time though!

{"text": "Okay, the home park for me, and was there today.  For an amusement park that you can get into for under $30, its ideal.  You have ravine flyer, which is a phenomenally good coaster that has an average wait time of  five minutes , which is reason enough to go, but there is a lot more to this park than youd expect. \n First, its small enough to do everything in the park in a day, without having to rush.  This includes the water park as well.  The park itself doesnt charge admission, so you can just walk around the park, pay for the rides you want to go on and go home, or get the pass that gives you everything.  There are some lovely picnic groves throughout the park, mostly at the south end, so you can easily bring a cooler, which brings us to..... \n You can bring your own beer to the park. \n Erie is a town that loves its booze, and the amusement park is no exception to this love. \n The water park is a pretty good size.  Actually went into the water park for the first time in a long time today, and its nice to know that absolutely nothing has changed about the park in that time.  Nothing. At. All. Other than paint.  A total of eleven large slides - four inner tube slides, and seven body slides, ranging from fully enclosed tubes, to open air, and even the free fall and speed slides.  [photos dont do them justice.](  I mention the last as they scared the shit out of me when I was young, and I finally went on them again today after about twenty years.  In addition to the slides, theres an endless river, and a decently equipped young childrens area.  There is a planned expansion next year to add a wave pool, and I found out today that this is phase one of a seven year expansion to the park.  Whether it is going to be just the water park or both parks, I dont know yet. \n Waldameer has a lot to offer, including, once again, a well stocked kids area at the north end of the park.  There are a lot of staple rides that the park has - wave swinger, swinging ship, disk-o vortex, tilt-a-whirl, wipeout, flying carpet, bumper cars, and a small drop tower.  There are some excellent older rides as well, like the scrambler and paratrooper, a train, and a carousel.  One of the newest rides added to the park was the Music Express, which, in my opinion, was a waste of money and no fun at all.  There is also a log flume - Thunder River - that does a reasonably good job of getting you drenched.  Good times.  It is also worth talking about the two classic dark rides at the park, Whacky Shack and Pirates Cove.  Both were designed by Bill Tracy in the 1970s, and still operate to this day.  The Whacky Shack is the must ride of the two, but the Cove is still a fun dark ride. \n Regarding the coasters: Waldameer isnt a coaster park.  With that being said, the coasters they do have are pretty damn fun.  The comet has been there since the 1950s and is the larger brother of the Little Dipper at Six Flags Great America.  Its fun, and has a decent amount of air time for a coaster that tops out at 37 feet.  Steel Dragon is just a damned pleasure to ride.  Perfectly amusing, well designed, and smooth as silk.  The rotation of the cars is a lovely element, and I find myself giggling almost constantly while I ride. \n Okay, Ravine Flyer.  It is almost absurd that this small little park on the lake shore has a coaster this good with an average wait time of  five freaking minutes .  If you want to spend the day riding this over and over, choose any day youd like.  I especially recommend riding this around dusk, because it seems like a wholly different ride in the near dark.  This ride rattles and throws you around, jumps you out of your seat for surprisingly long stretches of the layout, and does not disappoint in any way, other than wishing it were longer.  I usually will stop by the park just to ride this ride, and am actually doing the math on how many times I would have to pay the $4.50 per ride to justify buying the season pass for next year. \n In brief, Im a little biased as this is my home town park.  However, this little gemstone in the Gem City is a treasure to have in Erie.  Im greatly looking forward to seeing this park grow again, and, should I ever choose to adopt a child, this park will be a large part of their growing up. \n TL:DR  Go to Waldameer for the Ravine Flyer, stay for getting drunk and riding rides with a five minute wait \n", "features": ["names of individuals", "mentions of the color red", "phrases related to legal matters and sports injuries", "phrases related to restaurants and food chains", "phrases related to conflicts, injustices, and tragedies", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "phrases related to showcasing or demonstrating something"], "feature_ids": [2, 3, 19, 20, 25, 14, 13], "scores": [0.22, 0.01, 0.0, 0.22, 0.0, 0.0, 0.44]}

{"text": "I went through clearing last year, after arsing up my exams (ABCD, first choice was A*AAA) due to lack of revision and through sheer dumb luck ended up in Glasgow, an ancient Russell Group university that was rated third in the country for my subject. \n Going in to second year I wouldnt transfer to my first or insurance (Imperial or Warwick) if you paid me. \n Im not exaggerating when I say that A Level results day was the worst day of my life so far. Waking up to an email from UCAS at 8am that essentially says Youve failed and nobody wants you is soul destroying. Still had to trek into college to see just how badly Id failed - Id heard its always worth ringing if youre a only a grade or so away. Maybe I could still get in? Then theres the second crushing disappointment when I realised that not only have I definitely missed out on  my choices, but my grades are so low Id have to drastically lower my expectations of the sort of University I could attend. \n By now I was fairly despondent, faced with a choice between East Basingstoke Metropolitan University or repeating the last 12 months of my life under twice the pressure I was before. \n Im a bit sketchy on the times, but from what I can remember results were given out from 9am, and clearing didnt open until 10am. My college had a Clearing room set up, with phones, computers and Telegraphs along with some teachers  to offer advice. I  spent the worst part of an hour flicking through the Telegraphs clearing tables and, when it was accessible, the UCAS site. None of the options seemed particularly appealing, not helped by the occasional uni Id visited and disliked appearing in the list - campuses of sixties concrete monstrosities, not so much a gender ratio as a gender (in the singular) and all set against a backdrop of some dull uninspiring town or miserable suburb. If those places were in clearing, then presumably the rest were along similar lines. \n I half-heartedly googled some of the options, not really liking what I saw before returning to the list to scroll past a few more. I was surprised by the amount of choices which was the only thing keeping me going - the small glimmer that one of the choices was nice. \n The turning point was coming across Royal Holloway in the list. This was a good university, with a nice campus and close to London, an interesting place to live. Its not particularly well known for my subject but its a respected institution where you could be confident of a good course. I started to be more thorough, properly checking the ones I knew little about and eventually came to Glasgow. Ancient, Russell Group, the stunning Gothic main building, ranked highly in the league tables -  not the best reasons to choose a university, but given the circumstances I was pretty pleased.  There was the nerve-wracking phone call to their admissions department at 10am on the dot, asking if they still had places, reading my grades (which were still something of a raw wound) over the phone, and then the greatest rush of relief I have ever felt as he told me there and then I could have a place. \n Accommodation can be a nightmare after clearing - its possible youve already missed out on halls by the time all the paperwork has gone through, but I wouldnt let that put you off too much. Unless its nigh on certain youll get in to you first choice, and providing you are absolutely set on your first choice, I dont think resitting is a good option.

You can easily see who is streaking close, and reposition yourself around that guy to make the swing throw easier.  Or if necessary, you can run upline if they take the swing away quickly. \n The trick is that you have to watch the defenders coming, but keep your ears open to the sound of your teammate pancaking the disc.

{"text": "> Paul\n> Westbrook\n> Curry\n> Parker \n I can see those four, but thats about it. Dragic is coming off one good breakout season which was 17/6, so I wouldnt hold him over Kyrie (I consider him a SG anyway). Lawson and Lillard compared to Kyrie is a joke. Kyrie beats Lillard in pretty much any statistical category besides 3PT%. And to say Kyrie is atrocious on defense while putting Lillard, who is even worse on defense, ahead of him is ridiculous. Conley may have an argument, but I still think him and Rose are behind him. If Kyrie didnt have to play hero ball in the Mike Brown offense last year he would have shot better. John Wall couldnt do what Kyrie had to do. Maybe Lillard could, but not without his %s plunging. Id even argue hes better than Curry because Currys court vision (as well as Walls) is overrated and Kyries is underrated. \n Ive made my arguments for Kyrie > Wall and Kyrie >>>>> Lillard in other threads, Ill see if I can pull them up. \n Edit: Found the Lillard one: \n Kyrie [would win games too] if he had fucking LaMarcus Aldridge. His second best teammate until now would come off the bench in Portland. \n This year Kyrie had a down year. \n FG%:  Kyrie .430 , Lillard .424 \n 3PT%: Kyrie .358,  Lillard .394 \n ORB:  Kyrie 0.7 , Lillard 0.4 \n DRB: Kyrie 2.9,  Lillard 3.1 \n TRB:  Kyrie 3.6 , Lillard 3.5 \n AST:  Kyrie 6.1 , Lillard 5.6 \n STL:  Kyrie 1.5 , Lillard 0.8 \n BLK: Kyrie 0.3, Lillard 0.3 \n PPG:  Kyrie 20.8 , Lillard 20.7 \n Lillard has an edge in 3PT shooting, but it helps that he has teammates that are threats to give him open looks. Kyrie is dragging the offense in Cleveland. Being the 2nd/3rd option will do wonders for Kyrie this year, no doubt. \n And let me remind you, before you say Those stats are really close! Kyrie was carrying a Mike Brown offense (which is iso with your best player pretty much), while Lillard was with arguably the best PF and offense in the league. \n Not to mention Lillard is a terribly bad defender. Sure Kyrie is no Bruce Bowen, but hes not as bad as everyone says. \n And for those who say Lillard is better because of his 3PT%, Kyrie was at .391 last year, just having a drop-off adjusting to a brand new offense. Lillard had a huge jump (over 2% from last year), but was still just barely over Kyries from a year ago. \n Feel free to disagree, I just feel Kyrie (when hes not switching into a brand new offense with shitty teammates) is a much better player than Lillard, and people quickly abandoned him and jumped on the Lillard hype train. \n Edit 2: Found the Wall one \n Their stats are nearly identical, and for the argument that Wall is a better passer, hes not by that much. Wall can pass, yeah, but hes no CP3. 8.8 assists a game, but he also turns it over almost three times a game. Irvings passing has been consistent from year to year (with pretty bad teammates may I remind you) with around 6.4 APG, and his turnover numbers dropping by a whole turnover in a few years. Sure, he still turns it over almost three times a game too, but that comes with usage rate of 28.2%. Walls is 27.4% for comparison. While its not a gaping difference, Irving is turning it over the same amount with less possessions ending with him. This means Wall is turning it over more often with less chances, which indicates to me hes not as good a passer as people say, and Irving isnt too far behind him in that regard. \n While their FG% stats are similar, dont be fooled. Kyries stats go down because his best teammate is a toss-up between Tristan Thompson or Dion Waiters. He doesnt shoot in volume by choice, its because he has to. This brings down his %s a little and hes still comparable with Wall, who has, according to many, one of the best SGs in the league (I disagree, but thats for another argument), and contract year Trevor Ariza. \n ", "features": ["names of individuals", "phrases related to sports events and team news", "phrases related to legal matters and sports injuries", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "names of sports teams and players", "phrases related to showcasing or demonstrating something", "phrases related to laws, regulations, enforcement, and criminal activities", "phrases related to decision-making or judgment"], "feature_ids": [2, 109, 19, 14, 18, 13, 556, 30], "scores": [0.98, 0.99, 0.01, 0.01, 0.99, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01]}

While the news site mentions owned cats and the need to control them better, the actual scholarly article does not really make this claim anywhere. It merely says the need to de-sex your cat. \n I read the research link you sent me, not the one the news sites talk about. I admit it was interesting, however the main point it makes is how domestic cats impact the natural wildlife in high density population areas (aka cities). Its based in California, which has a higher population than all of Canada.

Look at their website. \n www.cink.ca \n I even took the pain of reading parts of that abomination of a website. They mention one study in it, which estimates how many birds cats will kill in a year. It is 4th on the list, right underneath collisions with buildings, collision with power lines, then recreational hunting. \n It even mentions rural areas.

{"text": "As for balance, theyre both in a very good place right now. However, Zed does require more skill to do well with. As such, he does have more overall potential, but more importantly outplay potential. You can confuse people like crazy with the shadows, while dealing insane amounts of AoE damage. Whereas Ahri is more about catching people, chasing them down, and killing them. \n Ahri is a lot more reliant on her ult than Zed is. Without her ult, Ahri has 0 mobility, whereas Zed can still jump around like crazy with his W. \n You might think Zeds ulti is his main ability, but in reality its actually his W. The reason why is because his W has such insane versatility. Its a gap closer, its an escape, it can slow (with E), it can reduce its cd (with E), get more range for Q, get more damage for Q, give vision, you can dodge skillshots, you can choose not to swap to it. Overall just a ton of utility. There is so much you can do with it. \n In teamfights they work very differently. A common misconception is that Zed doesnt do much in teamfights, or that he has to ult and kill the carry or else hes failed. This is of course completely false. Zed has a ton of AoE damage, and he can very easily reposition and dodge spells with his W. Due to the high AD you should be building on him (and its nice scaling with his W), you deal insane amounts of damage with auto attacks alone. Thing is, you should be constantly moving and dodging spells. You also dont at all have to jump for their carries, you can very much act as a lethal peeler. If someone jumps on YOUR ad carry, you can jump on them and effectively insta kill them with the help of your carry. If your team has CC, youre pretty much guaranteed to hit all your Qs in a teamfight, which results in even more damage. Zed works even better in close and confined spaces like the jungle, because he can jump over walls, hit people from where they cant see him, and single out people. \n On the other hand, Ahri is somewhat of the opposite. Ahri likes to be in the open and chunk down the enemies with spells, while dodging skillshots or chasing with her R. Catching a carry with her E pretty much results in a guaranteed kill if the rest of the team follows up (or if you have enough damage yourself to burst 100-0, which is not uncommon). She is a lot more reliant on her team, though. She doesnt have quite the same sustained damage as Zed does, or the same sustained mobility. \n As you might be able to tell, Im partial to Zed.

{"text": "Peering is necessary because some internet sites or routes generate more traffic than the regular infrastructure can handle. \n Think of it like this: a delivery is contracted by a city to handle all their mail. Normally, they use ordinary transport networks to handle all the demand, but sometimes theres a lot of traffic generated by one particular source - Amazon, perhaps. So, rather than clogging up the roads with Amazon trucks, delaying their own packages in the process, Amazon can set up a dedicated distribution network. \n One way they can do this is by contracting another company, who has a distribution hub ready on the outskirts of the city with a direct line to the delivery company - this is what Netflix attempt to do by peering with Cogent and Level 3, for service to Verizon users and others. Alternatively, they can work with the delivery company to build a new distribution link - this is what has happened with TWC. \n Now, the issue at hand is who should pay. To make this scenario analogous, we should add that all people in the city who want deliveries must pay a monthly fee, and the agreement is that they can get whatever they want delivered for that fee (perhaps theres a monthly cap, and theyre limited to stuff arriving at an advertised rate, say three packages per day) \n OK, but the problem was Amazons packages were only getting through at the rate of one per day, due to congestion. So the customers arent getting what they paid for. But the delivery company says that, since Amazon gets more customers when it can deliver more packages,  they  should pay for the dedicated link between Amazon and the city, rather than anything else. In another city, Verizonopolis, the mayor even  refused  to beef up their infrastructure for their delivery company and the third-party distribution hub that Amazon had chosen to use to get around the problem there. Amazon thinks this is unfair; its customers already pay for the products it delivers,  and  they pay the subscription fee to get 3 packages delivered every day, so why should  they  have to pay - and pass the costs on - just to get that advertised service? \n ", "features": ["phrases related to technical specifications and features", "phrases related to business and organizational positions", "phrases related to contracts or agreements", "phrases related to decision-making or judgment"], "feature_ids": [300, 323, 759, 30], "scores": [0.22, 0.02, 0.48, 0.18]}

So lets get to the next item. \n > orbiting a sun \n The diameter of earth orbit is approximatively 3x10^8 km. The closest star is Proxima centauri which is approximatively 4x10^13 km. Simple calculations show (see [wikipedia]( that this star has a parallax of 0.7687  arcsec. It means that the angle of displacement of this star throughout one year is approximately equivalent to the angle subtended by an object 2 centimeters in diameter located 5.3 kilometers away. \n (Imagine a 2cm object located 5.3km away ... yes it is small ! Modern telescopes can detect it, but clearly not your naked eyes.) \n > is moving through space at a high rate of speed \n Yes, but the other stars in the milky way are also moving mostly in the same global motion around the center of the galaxy. However, the star do not orbit at the same speed and there are many changes. \n > How do they all stay in the same relationship to each other when they are so far away? \n They dont ! But they change so slowly that you dont see it during your lifetime. But they move indeed ! For example, [these pictures]( show the shape of famous constellations in 50000 years from now. \n So they change constantly. Its just that human life is too short compared to the rate of change. \n > HOW THE HELL CAN THE NORTH STAR ALWAYS BE NORTH? \n It does not. See the  history of north star . For example, 14000 years ago, Vega could be taken as the north star (it was the brightest star near the location of the celestial pole) and it will be again in 12000 years. \n What I find fascinating is that earth is extremely old compared to the stars in the night sky. The first human being 4 millions years ago probably experienced a very different night sky from us, with completely different constellations in the sky. And evenmore, when life appeared 3 billion years ago, probably everything was different. During that long period of time, a lot of stars were born, others exploded, some created nebula, other formed clusters, ... (for example, the Pleiades only formed 100 million years ago, when the dinosaurs ruled the earth). \n ", "features": ["information related to historical figures and events", "phrases related to scientific research and organizations", "phrases related to expressing doubt or uncertainty", "phrases related to expressing strong opinions or directives"], "feature_ids": [12, 484, 90, 607], "scores": [0.02, 0.98, 0.02, 0.98]}

{"text": "Oddly enough, it happened by accident.  I went the safe route of music education because I knew that I wouldnt be able to make a living performing. \n Due to a paperwork mistake on the part of my college, I ended up with a degree by not certification.  No big deal, I planned to get alt-cert later, but in the meantime my wife had gotten a job far from the school.  They needed and accompanist.  I did not have the piano background for that, but they were desperate.  I basically got paid to practice piano for about 2.5 years. \n As a result of the choir director not getting me music on time or at all, I learned to comp from chords.  Later, a band was trying to get a keyboard player.  I thought it would be some shitty college-age garage band of people with no skill or desire for polish.  Turned out that it was an established group replacing a keyboard player and my combination of ear, theory background, reading ability, feel, and comping ability were pretty much perfect.  I started gigging while still accompanying at the school. \n By now I was also playing my original primary instrument, trumpet, around town and doing some musical theatre, church gigs, wedding gigs, etc. \n I eventually quit the school job because I didnt need it and they were trying to wrestle me into more and more band stuff that I wanst getting a stipend for.  By now I was working on learning all of the jazz stuff that I never learned in college.  I went from being the type of person who was married to the page to being a person who could comp stuff on the fly and learn partially by ear. \n So over time Ive just picked up more freelance work.  My wife is a woodwinds doubler, including oboe, which just doesnt exist.  And shes not a hack either. She was actually a doubler major in oboe and clarinet in college as well as all-state sax in HS.  She plays flute really well.  We do a good number of duet gigs.  We both play a little guitar as well, though were super hacks at that.  So between us with guitar, piano, harmony vocals, all of her ability to play instrumental leads and improvisation... as well as the fact that we (like my band) arent stuck in a single style and play pretty much everything and can be flexible to the venue... Yeah, theres a good deal of work out there. \n She still teaches as a day job (intermediate music).  She does private lessons as well because she just likes to.  I did some private lessons, but I dont love it and honestly, dont really need to. \n So now I just play freelance on piano (which Ive been playing for about 6 years seriously) and trumpet.  I also do some transcription and arranging work if it shows up, but I often turn it down if it comes during a time when Im heavily booked. \n I guess I dont love every bit of music I play or every venue I play, but I like most of them enough.  I like being musically versatile.  You make it sound like it would be terrible to play music I dont like or play venues I dont like for a paycheck.  But Ive worked in manual labor.  Ive worked as a stocker at Target.  Ive had some shitty jobs with low pay where I worked myself half to death.  Im not an idiot.  Im not going to go back to doing one of those shitty jobs to keep the dream alive and only sit around writing originals or playing genres I love just to be musically pure.  To me, thats idiotic.  Most people do things they dont like to make a living.  Even if I dont absolutely adore certain styles that I play for certain venues, I know Id much rather be doing that than almost anything else. \n People have this idea that musicians have to be the type constantly creating, or the type trying to get discovered on Youtube some they can be big stars.

TB is in the right and I love that he decided to start talking more about these things (though I never condemned him for not doing so or doing little of it previously). \n As an environmental lawyer IRL that writes about finding a way to bring sanity and better regulation to address the claims of both environmental defenders and market liberalism Ive often been called an environmental shiite by some and capitalist pig by others, so I know what a non-absolute stance will get you. \n Not taking absolute sides, not joining a pack, not having a common defined enemy aint easy, but I imagine it would be easier and better if everyone did it and that applies here in videogamesland as well (as it does on most discussions of any aspect of life) \n We need to stop condemning people for asking questions about these side-takers dogmas and to wonder whether  we  are right in the first place (or right  to what degree , you can be wrong about parts of something or just wrong about your approach etc.) before taking an oh-so-mighty and learned pompous stance of youll learn someday, you ignorant, or the shit-flinging stance or the public shaming one. \n We need to question ourselves even when we get attacked by supposedly idiotic arguments. \n An example: youre fighting for more equality for women in videogames. Thats  awesome , but then someone calls you some name and says youre ruining videogames. Now, thats probably untrue, but lets think from the other guys perspective. What did he mean? What is he so upset about? Maybe youve just been so pervasive and harsh in your intention to do good that the person cant even play a game without feeling bad, maybe he cant stand reading VG blogs anymore because all he sees are these issues being talked about and he feels like he sees less and less what he wants to read about, you know, just videogames.  That doesnt mean hes in the right for calling you names etc. , but just that  he has some motive and its important to try to understand it . The same way that  its important that he doesnt act like he did and try to understand why its important to people (and it should probably be important to him as well) that videogames be more accessible to everyone, including women. \n So thanks TB for jumping in this discussion. I never blamed you for not doing it as much before, because it really is a painful thing to do, but I applaud you for deciding to brave in and I hope more reasonable people decide to join in this debate and that the absolutists dont just think were all against them and start questioning themselves a little bit (as  everyone  should, me and you included). \n I also suggest people watch  Yahtzees latest Lets Drown Out  people and everybody might learn quite a lot from their discussion about how to have discussions.

People forget that the system sold over 10 million systems in 2 years on the market, thats a pretty good success in and of itself when you consider that the Saturn got to similar numbers in twice the time. The problem with the DC was that the early systems were easy to make play burned games, so people werent buying DC games. Software is usually where developers make their money, and they take a loss on hardware. \n I dont like Bernie Stolars work in the video game industry. Despite that he and the other Sega America executives had a great launch. Stolar even lowered the price from what the Japanese execs wanted to launch the system at. The American launch and the audience was quite successful. What Sega needed was the same to happen in Japan, and it didnt. The Saturn was huge in Japan, and even outsold the Playstation until about 1997-98ish. The Dreamcast in comparison was a flop. People also forget that there was still the Genesis being supported in some countries, and the Master System still had official support in Brazil until 1998. Cartridges are not cheap to produce at all, so this was also a money sink for Sega. \n So, lets assume that the Dreamcast gets a decent launch in Japan and starts to do a bit better from there. So in the same 2 years there could be 13-15 million Dreamcasts sold. This could be even worse with the piracy issue. So, lets say they catch the piracy problem and fix it a few months before launch. Now there are people who arent playing as many DC games, but theyre buying 1 or 2 every so often. Thats much better than selling somebody a system and them buying 0 games for 2 years. \n If the Japanese launch had been stronger and if there was no option for piracy then Sega could have done much better financially with the Dreamcast. As a collector I can say that piracy did hurt the system. Its not hard in the USA to find Dreamcast consoles on the second hand market locally, it is hard to find official Dreamcast games.

Animation, story, character, etc. The romance was done in a very believable manner, and even the wrap up with Korra and Mako being together makes sense when you consider it was supposed to be only one book, with nothing more. \n Then book two comes along, and the animation isnt quite as good. The characters are doing some things that viewers believe they wouldnt have done. Korra seemingly learns nothing from her time dealing with the Equalists or with Tenzin (people are irritated when she just drops him, due to all the things they went through together). \n Then within all the general disappointment of what book two is turning out to be comes the Beginnings episodes with Wan. Animation is brilliant, story is amazing, beautiful, and everything a fan of the series ever wanted an origin of the Avatar to be. \n And then its back to Korra... And its just not as good. Its confusing, its muddled with multiple characters doing stupid things while the romance sub-plot (while mainly interesting in book one) is just tired at this point. Mako and Asami worked well in book one, but now it feels forced. \n We get to the end and Korra gets separated from Raava, loses her past lives, beats the bad guy, and combines the worlds again. \n I think people hated this because everyone just thought Korra was the dumbest, most worthless piece of crap Avatar ever. How could she let ALL of this happen? She trusted UNALAQ over TENZIN? Let Unalaq become the Dark Avatar? Let Raava be taken out? Lost her connection with all her past lives? Then after everything, the most interesting point in the series had been Wan. An amazing character, who did phenomenal things for the world. HE separated the worlds, HE combined with Raava. In short: Hes the fucking MAN! And Korra decided the best thing to do is REVERSE his decision. This likely was seen as Korra just being an idiot again. How could Wan have been wrong?!?!?!?! \n Im not saying this is how I think the season was, though it fell short of season one, and much of the complaints leveled at it have at least a modicum of merit. I genuinely loved the spiritual aspect of the season, and so far nothing has been as painful (emotionally, and in a good way) to watch as Korra losing her past lives. That said, Unalaq was ultimately more boring than Amon as a villain, and the animation wasnt as good as in book one. \n I think if people re-watch all three books theyll find book two much more enjoyable than they initially did, but taken as a whole its still probably the weakest book in the series (even though the Beginnings were among the best of either series). \n ", "features": ["phrases related to expressing strong opinions or directives", "phrases related to expressing doubt or uncertainty", "phrases related to contentious or divisive topics in politics or society"], "feature_ids": [607, 90, 320], "scores": [0.98, 0.82, 0.92]}

This is a more advanced form of combat than US, and is not recommended for beginners (plus they get boned MM-wise) \n Russia- the most all around nation.

Where Singularitys gunplay and enemies are interesting, Legendarys are frustrating. The only exception is the BEASTLY fire-axe, which I rather enjoyed. \n -The graphics in this game are passable. They fit their purpose, but show their age.\n-The sounds are actually quite good. The burst-fire rifle in particular I enjoyed.\n-The voice acting is on the low side of B-movie quality. C+ movie, maybe.\n-The enemies, for the most part, are quite frustrating. The one enemy I did enjoy is the little rolling brimstone demons. Their AI was fun. \n Overall, the game is a disappointment. On the high-side, its generic. On the low-side, its teeth-gratingly frustrating. For example, let me explain the moment where I gave up on the game: \n There is a gigantic golem thrashing around the city streets (who for some reason attacks everyone else, but never tries to attack me), and Im running around charging up EMP generators. Working on the 3rd one, I ran into a building filled with little pixie enemies that can only be hit when they feel like it (they turn ethereal and seem to only turn solid when your back is turned), and some little will-o-wisp thing immediately possesses the EMP generator and moves it up a floor. After getting slashed in the back by a dozen more of the stupid little pixies, I make it upstairs, slightly charge the EMP, and it moves up another floor. Kill another dozen pixies, run up another floor, charge up some more, EMP moves to bottom floor again. Run all the way down after killing 2 dozen more pixies, charge up some more, EMP moves to middle floor again. Kill more pixies, run up another floor, charge up more, EMP moves AGAIN. Run to top floor, all the while killing pixies, charge up some more, it moves to a new spot on top floor, charge it up some more, and IT MOVES AGAIN! Smash Alt+F4 so hard the USB drive on my desk falls over. \n That is literally an exact account of what happens in that section. Not one single part of that whole encounter were challenging. The entire thing was just pecking at me. The dumb little pixies posed no threat, except to my patience, and there was no environmental danger either. If there were some increasing level of danger every time it moved, thats one thing, but to move the EMP generator just for the sake of moving it is nothing but busywork. \n I get that that is just one tiny moment in the game, and the rest of it could be good, but every single part of the game I did see was utterly joyless, and given how badly that one section \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ed me off, Im done giving Legendary any chances.

{"text": "I used to play most of the CoDs, and I enjoyed them until about a few years ago when I switched to CS. I havent looked back since, just because its a totally different experience. I was no MLG gamer, but I think Ill take a shot at answering :P \n \n I think to change CoD to be more competitive, youd have to lay down straight rules with simple approaches. The reason that Counter-Strike has a fairly large competitive scene is its reliance on straight skill. This means removal of \n \n Killstreaks: I understand, it takes some skill to get there, but after that its not much. \n \n Gun strengths and weaknesses : In most games, it seems like one gun during the meta is  THE  gun to use, and thats pretty much it. In Counter-Strike, pretty much every gun has a strength and weakness, used for different scenarios. \n \n Balanced/Even maps and spawns: The spawns and map balances in CS are usually lots better than CoD, and each area affects the game. \n \n At the moment, it seems like both CS and CoD have pretty similar selections for their competitive games: The best of the best (Correct me if Im wrong) are playing. However, Counter-Strike really relies on who has been playing longer, while in these yearly CoDs, you can quickly learn in one game, then have to change in the next, possibly. I think this comes down to just sticking with less games per year. \n \n Look at what youve done. As Tripwire Interactives CEO has said, Call of Duty has almost ruined a generation of shooters. I think CoD has pretty amazing potential, but now every game isnt really sold for an update or better ideas, but just for the money. The $15 dollar DLCs are outrageous, let alone $60 every year for a slightly changed game at times. \n \n I would definitely NOT pay $200 a year for the community change. Yes, the CoD community needs a MAJOR change, but I dont play enough in the first place for $200 a year. \n \n Unfortunately, yes. I can see that by releasing new games, you can say the skill is always changing and growing, but it makes it so hard to get into the game. For myself, I used to seem to get the game down after a few months, and then POOF, here comes the next CoD game, along with all of the players of the other flocking to it. \n \n Im not sure how others did it, but playing the League games and meeting people is how I got teams. This wasnt the best idea, but it worked. The same can happen in any other Competitive game. \n \n I dont think so. The reason CoD has its fame isnt really for PC, its for the Consoles. Its an easy way for anyone to get into a game they enjoy. Lets face it, when people say Yeah, I play Call of Duty on my Xbox or Yeah, I play Counter-Strike on my PC, the latter is more likely for people to say, Whats that? if they arent familiar. Consoles are where CoD lives, and sure, its pretty fun on PC, but they wouldnt change to only PC. \n \n No. Again, this comes back to console gaming. Sure, theres assholes on every platform, (See the League of Legends community) and toxic players exist everywhere. But you cant go very far into CoD competitive games without someone complaining about his teammate sucking so badly, or the horrible Your mom jokes being thrown around, and even the young kids screaming, CAN U GUIES HERE ME?. Its a headache all around. \n \n The only nice things I can say is, when you find those who really want to play, they play. Ive been in lobbies with trolls who think they are cute by imitating and ignoring to everything you do, but if there is more good than bad in the lobby, your teammates will help. \n \n In CoD, I had just gotten into Competitive when I left, partially because I was looking into a better competitive game. In Counter Strike, I mainly play Competitive, and am a very competitive person. \n \n \n I guess thats my 2 cents. Again, Im no expert, but thats what I think :) \n TL:DR: \n \n Remove Killstreaks, change spawns, Gun balance, map changes. \n Less of putting out a game every year. \n Look around, dont push shit out every year.

When you first start tanking you should be rotation your short cooldowns in order to keep yourself alive and not take to much flak from your healers.< \n \n \n Protection Paladins \n I played a protection paladin all through Cata and its one of my favorite characters to tank with.  As with druid tanking your single target threat generation is pretty solid, the real issue comes into play with AE threat generation, if youre under geared its going to make things very difficult as consecration deals light holy damage, holy nova deals light holy damage, and your shield toss ability only hits 3 targets, all of these abilities also have a long cooldown so you cant spam like you can as a druid.  As a holy paladin you also have to manage your stacks of holy power which you get from using certain abilities, as well as in some cases manage your mana (But that never happens once you become geared).  You also have some healing Cool downs and some raid-wide damage reduction abilities. \n Protection Warriors \n Here is where things start to become challenging, warriors are a different breed of tank in my opinion and from what ive experienced so far playing them im constantly starved for rage and i get hit like a truck.  (Granted im undergeared)  They play fairly simular to paladins but offer greater mobility and some greater crowd control abilities which make them beneficial for raiding and some of the best tanks in the game.  Your primary resource is RAGE!!!! which you use to damage your targets and generate threat, you also have stances Battle, protection (Where you will spend most of your time), and berserker stance.  I tend to find myself switching to battle stance to put out some extra dps when im not tanking and then switching back to protection before i taunt.  Warriors also have a good mix of defensive cooldowns simular to the druid but have a raidwide buff to help reduce damage. \n Blood Death Knights \n Ive never tanked with a blood DK before from what i know of them you have to manage your runes and diseases, in recent years blizz has made it much easier to tank with them by combining some of the abilites to reduce bloat and difficulty.  They are avoidance base which means until you have reasonable gear youre going to get hit pretty hard.  They dont really have a lot of mobility but you can peal mobs off your group members with deathgrip.  Youre single target and AE threat gen are very good its like 2 abilities you need to spam to do aoe damage.  If youre trying to solo something you are also practically indestructible giving the right build and rotation. \n Brewmaster Monk \n Alright now here comes what i personally believe to be the most difficult class/spec combination to play.  First off if you dont know what youre doing and you dont keep your buffs up youre probably going to die... lots... especially if you are undergeared.  Once you become geared however monks are probably the best tanks in the game right now, although they also require the highest skill cap.  You have energy and CHI, use energy to generate chi which you use to do damage or apply your self-buffs to reduce damage.  If these self-buffs fall off of you or you forget to wipe your stacks of stutter your going to take a shit tonne of damage and your healers are going to chew you out.  I would say they play like a druid but with the highest mobility and the highest amount of AE damage.  One of the largest issues i have with monk tanking is that you have no defensive stat,  and when i say this i mean, druids have lots of armor, warriors and paladins have shields they can block with and DKs have a mix of armor and parry, monks being leather wears get no shield, no block, and no high amounts of armor to help mitigate the damage. \n \n So to recap or TL:DR, \n \n Druids: fun, mobile, easy, meaty (and youre a bear) \n Paladins: Slow, good single target, crappy AE damage, Shield, bubble \n Warriors: Mobile, hard hitting, good CDs, easy threat gen, lots of CC abilities \n Death Knights: Good raid utility, great survivalist, Good self buffs \n Monks: Best tanks in the game, high skill cap, great damage, great cooldowns, great threat Gen \n \n *I also neglected to mention that druids, paladins, and monks are jack of all trades classes, meaning they can tank, dps, and heal. \n *I hoped this helped you out a bit, i would highly recommend druid as you already have a druid and can just re-gem and enchant your feral gear over to tank.  GL!!! \n *Holy shit i took like 30 mins typing this up! \n", "features": ["names of individuals", "phrases related to showcasing or demonstrating something", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "names of sports teams and players", "phrases related to restaurants and food chains", "phrases related to conflicts, injustices, and tragedies", "news articles related to various topics like government, legislation, sports, and health", "phrases related to expressing doubt or uncertainty", "phrases related to expressing personal opinions or perspectives"], "feature_ids": [2, 13, 14, 18, 20, 25, 26, 90, 281], "scores": [0.98, 0.02, 0.01, 0.99, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.99]}

{"text": "While I find NGNLs unique animation appealing, its not enough without giving the characters depth. If I were to just sketch you a real ally great picture of a new anime girl you vote for her? \n Some people view anime as having a legitimate place among art, philosophy, and literature. In other words, anime is the result of things such as creativity, imagination, questioning the human condition, technique, general story telling, etc... and should be critiqued as such. Critique is a good thing. We all differ in opinion but we can still work together to reason why things should or should not be considered good aspects of anime. For example, every anime shares tropes of some kind with other anime, these tropes might be considered good aspects to add to an anime which allow creators a commonality which they may try to improve upon. When creators choose to give too much attention to these tropes, or riddle the anime with fan service, the cost tends to be quality in areas that help keep good anime well rounded. Such shows might be just as popular, but to the critic that is not a reason to view them as being of equal quality. Ex- For a while Twilight was more popular than Shakespeare, and many people preferred reading Twilight. Does this make Twilight better literature than Shakespeare? I doubt many people would attempt that argument. \n NGNL is a show that put a lot of effort into their creative art style and fan service, but they seemed to neglect the actual characters themselves. Is there anything about Shiro that is unique or interesting in a way that draws in the viewer or really creates a connection? Honestly, there simply is not. Shiro is arguably the weakest element of the show. Yuno, on the other hand, is almost indisputably the strongest element of Mirai Nikki. She has amazing depth and personality that keeps the viewer interested (even if you dont like her) and is bound to have at least some aspect that the viewer can relate to. Additionally, Yunos character takes a good anime personality type, yandere, and develops it in such way as to benefit anime itself; well undoubtedly see more extreme yandere done in a tasteful manner. \n ", "features": ["phrases related to political commentary and society opinion", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "phrases related to laws, regulations, enforcement, and criminal activities", "phrases related to news articles and journalism", "phrases related to technical and contractual information"], "feature_ids": [755, 14, 556, 718, 185], "scores": [-0.22, -0.01, -0.01, 0.01, -0.01]}

Statistically, over a long enough time playing ranked, the odds of having someone on your team who doesnt know what theyre doing is the same as the odds of there being someone on the enemy team who doesnt know what theyre doing. In a small sample size (say, 10 games), that one game makes a big difference as far as statistics go, but its going to be fairly rare over longer periods of time and  therell be about the same amount of total AFKs on your team as there have been on the enemy team . \n It may be that youre just on a bad luck streak. Sit back, take a deep breath, and look at your match history . If youve lost several games in a row, odds are that youre having bad luck, which may be affecting your own play depending on your own mental fortitude.  Take a break, take a nap, take a jog and come back later. \n It may be that your mechanics are just rusty . What I find happens to me is that I typically lose or struggle in my first game of the day. I try to play a normal for my first game of the day to reduce stress; this means that I can get warmed up and make sure that my mechanics are fine before jumping into ranked. This may also be putting you on tilt; losing the first games kind of demoralizing, and if you keep playing without taking a break, thats probably going to affect your play in game two and three and four, making it exponentially worse. \n It may be that your own skill is to blame . Minute things such as AFKs and potentially incompetent people normalize and become non-factors across a sufficient quantity of games, becoming essentially uniform. This leaves only one variable: your play. This is why the ranked system works; over a long enough period of time, you will end up at whatever rank it is that you deserve. As such, your current skill level may correspond accurately to your current rank.  Focus on improving, strategically and mechanically, and dont necessarily focus on the win or the loss. After a game, go back and look only at yourself, and say Am I satisfied with how I warded/farmed/roamed/looked for kills/positioned/teamfought that game? \n ", "features": ["phrases related to expressing doubt or uncertainty", "phrases related to advice and personal experiences", "phrases related to legal matters and sports injuries", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "phrases related to sports events and team news", "phrases related to decision-making or judgment"], "feature_ids": [90, 122, 19, 14, 109, 30], "scores": [0.22, 0.98, 0.02, 0.01, 0.92, 0.85]}

{"text": "Id be very hesitant to throw out claims like that, especially considering the vast majority of what google has been working on  in regards to its cars is image analysis. \n Now, in sunny day conditions, Visual Light spectrum cameras, much like people, can see things miles away. Unfortunately in low light conditions, visual light is about as useful as tits on a bull. \n So the solution is to use an IR camera when its night. Great, now the resolutions way down. Double great, now any ambient light (street lights, house lights) is going to cause washout periods, effectively rendering the vehicle blind. Triple great, the passive IR cameras that can see far enough to be driving at highway speeds cost more than most peoples cars. \n So using an IR camera is right out. Then someone says, Hey, why dont we just use an IR distance sensor array, you know, like the things a lot of people already have in their cars for collision detection. Great solution, theyre cheap and have been in use for years. Their response is non linear, meaning a hell of a lot more cycles are going to have to be spent determining whether the object in-front of the car is moving or stationary, and limited to a couple of hundred meters, but lets assume thats all worked out. \n Now the issue is that theyre line of sight, and can only detect what is directly in front of them. Now hills become an issue. Bends in a country road where a driver could potentially see through the treeline/over the fence, but the sensors might not. Will it be able to see things on the side of the road, like this deer? \n Lets assume all the issues above are worked out. The car is now goddamn Hiemdall, it sees all but it cant know all. It sees the deer at the side of the road. How will it interpret it? Will it slam on the brakes, expecting it to jump into the middle of the road? Will it simply slow down? Deer stand pretty still, what if it thinks its a funny shaped tree or a deer lawn ornament? \n TL,DR  ~ Software is not magic. Sensors are not magic. They are only as good as the people that designed and implemented them, and people cant think of literally every solution.

Rather than what he could of done, try thinking of what he thought, what he felt. \n Most normal teenagers will go through enough shit during those years of their lives. Hormones, increased responsibilities, searching for ones identity or place in the world, these are worries everyone goes through. In Ames case, his half wolf nature made his identity confusion all the greater. Growing up, it was never clear if he was a human or a wolf. However, we can see that he was never able to connect with any humans outside his family. He grows up never feeling truly accepted by human society because of his wolf blood. \n Then one day when he tries to catch a bird and almost drowns in a freezing river he discovers something. Theres a bit of thrill, but more than anything, he finds a deep, primal instinct that for once makes him feel like a wolf and realize that theres more possibility out there for him. Then he meets his teacher. He learns of the rocks, the trees, the scent of mountain air, the thrill of tracking prey, and the vastness of the forest. Its a whole new world, and to him seems captivating and beautiful. After all that time in the human world, feeling confused, out of place, caged, Ame finally feels like theres a place where he can truly be himself. This new world accepts him, and through it, the identity which he used to be so confused about becomes much clearer. \n While it might seem to make sense for Ame to live a duplicate life, this option wouldnt really have been possible for him. His time living among humans would have seemed like a lie, the facts taught to rangers would seem obsolete, and above else, he would not feel like he belonged. Once he made his decision to decision to run off into the woods, there was no going back for him. \n This decision wasnt necessarily inevitable though. Despite what others seem to think, I believe he loves Hana. Before the worst of the rain, she tells him not to leave, and to some extent he agrees because he loves her. His teacher being injured is what tipped him over the other way. His connection with the land and sense of duty to fill teachers shoes (paws?) pushed him to make the choice to go out into the storm. At the end of the film before he leaves for good, Hana tells him to wait. Ame is already in wolf form, but he turns around and clearly looks upset. He wants to go to her, but knows if he does, he will end up trapped in the human world again. \n Every parent needs to let their children grow up and live their own lives eventually. For Hana, this situation comes very early and very suddenly. Shes devastated, but when she hears Ames howl she realizes that he has found a life he for himself. One where he can be happy. One where he really belongs.  I think its because of this that she could smile and wish him off, telling him to take care, and to live his life. \n Anyway, those are my thoughts on Ame and the film. It turned out a lot longer than I expected.

This sealing is done by living Mormons in Mormon temples as follows: a live person acting as proxy is: baptized for the dead person, confirmed a member of the Mormon church and given the gift of the holy ghost by the laying on of hands for the dead person, ordained to the priesthood (dead men only), given the endowment for the dead person (see below), and sealed to parents and spouse and children for the dead person (if family members are known). \n The endowment is a series of five covenants, four of them with accompanying secret names, secret hand motions, and secret handshakes. Im not making that up--you can now read the endowment ceremony leaked online. \n TL:dr  Mormons are into family history and will help you find out your ancestors.

{"text": "Seems fairly coherent, rests on a few key assumptions though. The longer we exist, the smarter we (collectively) become. The smarter we become - the more we understand the universe and how we function. Is this more likely to lead to compassion and understanding? I would tend to think so based on personal experience. Steven Pinker argues that we live in the most peaceful time (relatively) in human history just because of this. \n The biggest problem I see is that your equilibrating force (increased intelligence/happiness/compassion between members of the race) would have to outweigh the disequilibrating forces of unrestrained anger/ignorance/technological disaster. \n Unfortunately, as technology is progressing at an arguably exponential rate, I would argue that our capacity to  do harm  and disequilibrate is increasing at the same rate.

These days, we are more than capable of nuclear armageddon, or destroying our own planet, or rendering it anarchic with a large-scale modern war.

We may have gifted ourselves with too much power and too little intellectual restraint to utilise it. Arming each other with world-ending devices when our brains are still governed by the laws of the jungle seems like it may just prevent the happy nirvana Id prefer us to achieve. \n TL:DR:  Our capacity for doing harm is increasing at an exponential rate, and if this rate remains greater than our capacity for mutual compassion etc. then statistics would indicate we are a doomed race in the long run. \n", "features": ["phrases related to conflicts, injustices, and tragedies", "phrases related to expressing strong opinions or directives", "phrases related to expressing doubt or uncertainty", "phrases related to scientific research and organizations", "phrases related to expressing personal opinions or perspectives"], "feature_ids": [25, 607, 90, 484, 281], "scores": [0.22, 0.85, 0.67, 0.42, 0.93]}

We did a pretty extensive study on plagues and calamities for large societies that year, and were taught basically everything wed need to know, by heart, in case something crazy really happened. We all knew how to build and use a simple HAM radio system, and could create a water filtration and purification system with a bottle of bleach, metal barrel, ashes, and sand. We learned to communicate throughout classes in codes, which we re-designed every monday, and by the end of the year had begun studying Spanish, Mandarin, and French simultaneously. We did this with the days split into three parts where we focused on each  language for a few hours before moving on to the next. \n Our projects that year included working alternatives to gunpowder weaponry, trebuchets, paper crossbows, you name it, and a fairly extensive classroom study on hysteria in society when things go wrong, acting out situations such as 9/11 first response and mock international forums on past calamitous events, like Hiroshima, Chernobyl, WW1, WW2, tons of mass murders, etc. \n How did it all end? Well, the state suddenly cut funding to the program and everyone was sent back to their regular school and classes. We retained all of the free-roam rights we had achieved previously. But school was never the same. I stopped caring while I was at school, researching new things I was interested when I came home. Pretty soon I was in middle school, then high school, still not really caring about standardized studies because I had already developed a taste for free thought and personal understanding of the world around me. I breezed through my first couple years of high school, got my GED with maxed percentiles and went straight to university at 16. \n Then real life struck and fucked all my plans and now Im 21, broke as fuck, with no degree, no job, (though Ive worked many professional jobs in the past 4 years), and very little faith in humanity. I drive a douchebag bright ass CoD style gold Honda, and hate everything and everyone as a hobby. \n ", "features": ["information related to historical figures and events", "phrases related to showcasing or demonstrating something", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "phrases related to conflicts, injustices, and tragedies", "phrases related to legal matters and sports injuries", "phrases related to restaurants and food chains", "information related to the German language", "phrases related to direction and movement", "phrases related to decision-making or judgment"], "feature_ids": [12, 13, 14, 25, 19, 20, 21, 23, 30], "scores": [0.98, 0.22, 0.82, 0.98, 0.18, 0.02, 0.04, 0.14, 0.68]}

{"text": "I was apart of my elementary schools GATE (Gifted And Talented Education) program. Basically I was just put in the challenging classes and had to do some extra stuff outside of normal class time. I dont really remember a whole lot about my elementary school life, but I did like the math and science sections but hated the history. Still not a history guy to this day. \n Being in GATE in elementary school meant when I moved to middle school I had no choice but to be put into advanced courses. Advanced English and Intro to Algebra (the class before Algebra in my district) were the classes I had to take 7th grade, and then I moved up to the next classes in 8th. I really didnt like Advanced English and dont know why I was forced into it. I didnt like my 8th grade teacher a whole lot and it just ended on a sour note. Still passed and went to high school though. \n The only GATE influence that was really prevalent in my high school life was through my math classes. I was in Geometry (a Sophomore class) during my freshman year, so I wasnt a genius but I was advanced to an extent. I refused to be in an honors English class because they suck asshole and I didnt want to read Moby Dick. I was put in Algebra 2 Honors my sophomore year, but do to personal events I became depressed and got a C in the class. I was in the normal English class up until now, too. \n My Junior year I had pre-calc and a falling out of sorts with my love for math. Passed it with a C, basically. My school decided to put me in American Lit, which was the lowest tier of English class for a Junior (the next tier would be English Lit, which I took Senior year, and then AP English which I had no interest in taking). The American Lit class was filled with those slacker types who I dont even know if half of them went to a 4 year college. One of my friends went through Le Cordon Bleu and is now cooking at Disney World at Epcot and another went through ITT Tech, but I am 90% sure the rest of the kids in that class burned out when they hit community college. I really enjoyed the class. We got to read George Orwell and Kurt Vonnegut, among the authors I actually remember. The teacher was crazy passionate about the subject and it really made me comfortable with writing. \n Senior year I ended up taking AP Statistics as my math course, which coincidentally another one of the GATE kids from my elementary school was in, and it was incredibly interesting to me. I found statistics a bit more realistic in its methods. Got a 3 on the AP exam, but an A in the class. \n I went to community college right after high school as a music major. Without this background I wouldnt be where I am today. I learned a lot about music (enough for me to hold an intelligent conversation about it) but eventually found my passion in Drama and in Sociology. 3 years after I started community college, I transferred this past year with an Associates in Social in Behavioral Sciences with a 3.81 (honors) and am going to UC Irvine as a Sociology major. Im planning on signing up for a double major in Drama in the Fall as well. \n ", "features": ["names of individuals"], "feature_ids": [2], "scores": [0.01]}

{"text": "I was considered a gifted child throughout most of elementary school and early middle school. \n Domestic issues stunted my social development. My parents were divorcing, and there were nights when I would regularly be out past 3 am with my Mom driving around random apartment buildings looking for my Dads car. I was never taught to do laundry, so when my Mom was too depressed to do so, I wouldnt have clean clothes. On one occasion, I wore the same shirt for 4 days, there was a lot of social stigma to being sprayed with Febreze by my fifth grade teacher. It didnt get much better over time. I scraped by in the fifth grade. In the sixth grade I had to attend summer school (shoutout to the teachers who understood why I was in the back, sleeping, rather than participating). \n I outright failed the seventh grade. In fact, I failed the seventh grade three consecutive times. I had given up at this point. Theres not a single thing that I can attribute the failures to, it was a sort of volatile cocktail of familial dysfunction and a toxic school environment. As I had failed the seventh grade, the set of teachers assigned to that grade had grown familiar with me. I would say that it was a dividing issue, some teachers were accommodating of my situation, and some were not. Particularly, my social sciences, and general science teachers were very kind to me. Those were the classes that I managed to pass, even so, I would say that it affects me still in that Sociology is my field of study (yes, there is a happy ending). My math teacher was rather cruel. She didnt quite seem to understand that I had an understanding of the subject, but would not, or could not, be bothered to do homework which is particularly difficult when youre already barely managing your own dysfunction as well as the dysfunction coming from living with a depressed single parent. Her criticisms focused solely on my failings. \n After failing the seventh grade for the third time I was tested for cognitive deficiencies. I was perfectly well. I recognize the test today as being an IQ test. I was moved to a different school district and to the eighth at this point, to a magnet program out of Stuart Middle School in Louisville, KY (google the school, the news stories arent pretty). \n This went about as one would expect it to go. I had to move in with my Father who was living with his parents at the time. He was abusive and had been the one to leave the family, I resented him greatly. I was moved to a new environment, the children were about as harsh as before, where the teachers were much more attuned to my lack of function, the teachers were very nice as theyd all dealt with children from dysfunctional families. None of the factors contributing to my own personal dysfunction had been addressed, so I was still failing, and truant. \n To be quite honest, the rest is a blur. I remember failing at Stuart. I remember moving back in with my Mother. I remember transferring to a school that had been recently built because of issues with overcrowding. I also remember when my mom removed me from middle school. When I moved back with my mom, to the new school, the truancy officers gave a damn and were hounding her. She pulled me out of middle school and and I was, from the eighth grade onward, homeschooled. \n Homeschool wasnt something that happened. I stayed home. Mom went to work. I did nothing. I still had neighborhood friends, I was told to lie to them about what had happened to me. I still had crushes. I remember at one point I was heavy into Manga and LoTR, there was a girl Id swap Manga with. Stephanie B was a bit of humanity in an unwieldy forest of dysfunction and lack of control. I totally crushed on her. Same with my neighbors children, though, at the time, I was hypersensitive to kindness. Lets just summarize this paragraph by saying that my social life suffered, but that I was able to find a surrogate social life in the burgeoning World of W---  cough  online gaming. \n I was able to socialize well enough after that point. I sort of hermitted myself away from the world. I would do odd jobs to pay sub fees. Eventually things stabilized and I found a nice group of people. I was able to function with a sense of interdependence with these people, and that helped me out a lot. We wound up taking a lot of the Server First achievements during the WoTLK era on the server Shadowsong. \n At age nineteen, I was still emotionally bruised. I lacked confidence in my academic ability, but my great grandmother had recently died. She had died believing that I was taking classes to earn my GED, this was a lie. So I felt horrible. I felt horrible enough to take the actual GED placement test, which indicated that I should just take the actual GED test. I passed with ease, despite any lack of formal education beyond the eighth grade. I received my GED in the mail about 2 weeks later. At this point, my older brother was addicted to pills. I was satisfied with a manual labor type job. One day I came home to find that all of my things had been stolen. Including a lot of morgan and peace silver dollars from my great grandmother. I quit my job and fell into a sense of apathy. Why should I even work when it means so little. \n I came out of it with a sort of resolve. I wanted better. I wound up enrolling into a community college Associates in Arts program at Jefferson Technical and Community Colleges Bullitt County campus. I met some amazing people. People who inspired me. I didnt have a whole lot of money, so it took me about 3 years to be able to afford the cost of 60 credit hours, but I did it. To be fair, I do not actually have an AA. I am about 3 credit hours short, but I transfered out and am still working on a degree program at a different institution. I kinda hope to return to JCTCs to finish that out. I suppose if I were a rich man I would fund the amazing things that are happening at that particular CC campus. \n Today I have an amazing girlfriend. She is working on her Masters in Developmental Psychology. I am slogging through a BS in Sociology program at Indiana University Southeast (Go, Grenadiers!). Today, I am happy. I have escaped that feeling that it was somehow my fault that Id performed so poorly in public school. I realize now that the odds were simply stacked against me. While I am still poor, I make due, and thats enough to keep me content.

{"text": "To me it sounds like you focus on the wrong things. Sure you are balding, and if your self-confidence is kinda low, that can be a bitch.  Like many others said, if that feels like a big problem for you, shave it off. \n So what you are a virgin? You are 28, not 16,  I guess it matters to you , but people around you shouldnt really care. If they are true friends. \n To me you have two ways to go, to getting laid that is. This is going to be a long fucking post by the way.. \n The first way , even though it will probably take some time is more safe. Try to find a girl you click with, internet dating or tinder is a good way to go. Try to find someone interesting, dont really go by looks at first, you need to build up your confidence,  thats my opinion at least .  On tinder swipe yes on everybody, sooner or later youll get a match. \n Try to chat with some just casual at first to give you a boost, sure you usually end up as friends with most girls, but so did I a couple of years ago. When or even if you already feel like it, try to find someone youd like to meet, dont be too pushy about it, but dont wait for too long as well. Try to get to know her, dont talk about sex,  unless she takes it up first, then you are good to go, but that is the second method ill take up later. \n You need to grab the bull by the horns and just try to start meeting girls, even if it ends up being with a girl you rate a 1-3 on a 10 grade scale,  again to build up your confidence . At first it will probably feel like its impossible, or you are getting nowhere, but hang in there. In time try to go for higher numbers, ive slept with girls that id range from 2 to 9, but usually they end up around 5-6. What I mean is, dont try to get 9s or 10s from the start. Youll be rejected by 5s, 4s even 2s, but everyone that isnt Brad Pitt or Ryan Gosling will be rejected. In the end youll find someone youll click with and clicks with you. \n The second way  is a bit harder and requires more balls or stupidity depends on how you see it. Same again here, you need to grab the bull by the horns, but now its more sex-focused. \n Same as last time, id recommend tinder and the internet, wherever \nyou think you can find loose girls. Dont try the sex-sites though.. Start chatting. Be nice and try not to be pervy about it. Anyone can charm their way into a girls pants if they do it the right way, and as a bartender and a guy with a lot of female friends my guess is that you have to be a charming guy. If you start with the  first way  you can eventually read out which girls that you can take straight to bed. \n \n Girls that try to look like nice girls on their pics, but just a little too much cleavage, are usually a good start. \n \n Some just starts talking about sex. Good to go.(But dont be too pushy about meeting up) \n \n \n Youll find signs of your own, just remember that youll be rejected. \n In my opinion your biggest obstacle for having sex or finding a girl is your attitude about yourself.  I could be totally wrong, and if that is the case I am really sorry. \n The  second way  worked out for me, but  my story  is a bit different: \n When I was around 20 I got dumped by my first gf, before I met her,  she were the one coming on to me btw , I were much like you describe yourself. Had tons of female friends, but never anyone that seemed interested in a relationship with me. I was a nice guy, but unfuckable. \n Guys usually say, or nice guys usually say its because they are too nice and thats why they never find a girlfriend, that is not the truth, its because they are too insecure in themselves and they usually aim too high. \n When I got dumped, I was crushed, heart broken, I thought I would get back to my old ways and never find a girl again. After six months of sobbing and feeling sorry for myself I decided; fuck it, Im going to be a dick and fuck as many girls as I can. \n With that mindset, I went out on a hunt, in bars, on the internet, everywhere I could find girls. I got rejected,  a lot , but that didnt stop me. I started to aim at girls which I saw as the same level as my ex, which in my mind at that time was a 7.5,  when I look back at it today ill rate her as a 5, she was my first love so my mind was a bit clouded at the time . When I got rejected time after time I lowered my standards, the first one I hooked up with was a 4 in my eyes. From there I worked my way up as my confidence grew. \nIn the end Id fucked around 20 girls during that summer, and I had 4 girls that I could call and hook up with whenever I wanted. \nIn the end: I fell in love with one of them, she dumped me. One got pregnant. One stalked me. And the last one gave me chlamydia. \n So that lifestyle wasnt for me. \n Sorry if my english is kinda bad, its not my native language. \n ", "features": ["phrases related to legal matters and sports injuries", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "phrases related to expressing strong opinions or directives", "phrases related to advice and personal experiences", "phrases related to expressing personal opinions or perspectives", "phrases related to decision-making or judgment", "phrases related to expressing doubt or uncertainty"], "feature_ids": [19, 14, 607, 122, 281, 30, 90], "scores": [0.01, 0.02, 0.51, 0.81, 0.92, 0.41, 0.11]}

{"text": "Also gonna have to say yes and no to your comment. There are plenty of hybrid and casual frames with curved tubing and compact frames with straight tubing. \n In fact, most compact road frames currently on the market have relatively straight top tubes- Giant TCR, Trek Madone/Domane/Emonda, Focus Izalco, etc. etc. etc. Specialized is currently the only major manufacturer to have noticeably curved top tubes, which is probably where you got that impression. Of course, this statement is also subject to change if manufacturers decide that the next visual trend is to switch their frame shapes up, but given that most brands already did this very recently, were looking at another couple years before a major frame shape redesign. \n The truth of it is that the equivalent compact vs horizontal top tube frames should handle the same, if the compact design is the only change. All they do with a compact design is essentially shorten the seat tube, make the top tube slope down to meet it, and adjust the seatstays accordingly. \n Theoretically, the benefit of a compact road geometry is that the compact frames can be built with less material for a frame of the equivalent size, thus both lightening (less material) and stiffening (shorter tubes means less material to twist) the bike.

In one smooth, gentle movement, just as I was sliding backwards, the spin took the right side of the van into the snowbank. The vehicle tipped over and slid gracefully across the 5-foot-deep snow.

{"text": "Lets step back and look at this: home buyers and renters are two different demographics. A renter MAY at some point turn into a home buyer, or they may be renters for a few reasons, two of which will make it very difficult to convert them to a different religion: \n \n They dont want to own a home. Because when they run the numbers it just doesnt make sense to them. Or because they dont have time to take care of it. Or because they are getting to old to take care of it. \n \n They can only afford to rent. You usually qualify for a mortgage of up to 2.5 times your income. So for a $300k house, you are looking at $150k salary a year, plus $30,000+ down payment. \n \n They got burnt in the Great Recession. They were foreclosed on, their credit was wrecked, they have the emotional baggage to match it. \n \n They are saving up to own a home and will one day. Maybe they are new to the area and trying to figure out the best neighborhoods, maybe they are just starting their careers, newly weds, etc. \n \n \n Your first step is to do the market research on the area you live in. What are the average renters like? What are their incomes like? What are their current costs of living like? Does it allow for them to put money back to own a home? Can they afford to own a home in your area...in a location that is as nice and safe as where they can rent one in? This is to determine if it is even worth the time to throw a bunch of money at remarketing to them or if it would just be easier to put it in a pile and set it on fire. \n At the same time, look into other marketing targets that you can potentially tap that would give you a greater ROI. There are, see the end of this for my recommendation. \n Ok, so you determined that it would be worth it, either their are homes available for under $300k that would work with the average renters salary, there are programs available to help or a majority of the renters are upper class and can afford to be homeowners, just arent for reasons that can be changed. \n Develop a profile for what the renters with the best possibility of moving up to home owner: salary, demographics, interests, concerns, and most importantly: what is stopping them from pulling the trigger on a house. These are the hot leads. \n You need to segment your lead list in order not to risk spamming people like those in group 1 who have no interest or 3 those with emotional scars from even coming back to you as rental clients. Send them emails before their lease expires is a great idea, but highlight a dozen or so new rental properties available, two or three homesales available and add a call for action RE: Interested in homeownership? Lets meet for coffee and we can help answer your questions and programs available. or something along those lines. Its relatively inexpensive, but dont expect a large return on new homeowners from it. \n What your broker needs to do is develop relationship building communications, not just spamming the crap out of people with marketing pieces. She needs to research/develop a CRM system plan (like salesforce) for this and train her realtors how to collect personal information during discussion, then how to quantify that lead for their potential to move from renter to homeowner. The hot leads are the ones that you focus on growing. \n You launch a program designed to help provide information on savings resources, homeowners programs, homeownership 101. Call them to see how things are, send them welcome baskets when they first signed their lease, etc. These are the ways to form a relationship with potential buyers and help them take steps towards the ultimate goal: closing. \n Its a lot of work for not a lot of coin. Instead of trying to remarket traditional renters, you could start a marketing campaign helping potential buyers find short term rentals while they look for a house. A lot of people in our area come from up north after they sold their house and need something temporary while finding a more permanent place. You could work out deals with landlords to give them a bonus from the commission of the sale in exchange for the extra work involved catering to the temporary situation. \n OR hold first home buyer workshops to gather leads. \n If she really wants to remarket previous clients, she has a better chance of remarketing to current homeowners. These are the people who have collateral to their names. They also offer you two chances at commission: sell their current house, get commission.

{"text": "Puppicide. \n While visiting a friend living in Madrid, we decided to take a last minute trip to Granada for the weekend and booked one of the regions cave houses, tiny apartments carved into the hillsides hundreds of years ago by peasant farmers. The house we rented was pretty far off the beaten path and down a small alley in the hills. We didnt see many neighbors out and about but there were some scrappy looking dogs roaming in packs. \n Thought Im not sure if this is a feature in most cave houses, ours had two doors separated by a short entryway. The street side door was heavy and metal with the inner door being wood with open slats on the top for peering out. \n One night after dinner we were sitting inside, quietly reading and drinking wine. The day had been particularly hot so my friend had opened the street facing metal door to let in more cool air. We could hear some soft murmurs from the street, probably a few people passing by, but mostly it was quiet. \n Until the whimpering began. \n We both looked up from our books and at each other quizzically. It sounded like an injured animal out in the street so we got up to investigate. \n We were only kind of right. \n As soon as we opened the inner wood door we spotted the source of whimpering: a tiny white and brown puppy with its throat torn open. The poor little thing had escaped into the entryway after being attacked. \n My friend and I are both from developed areas where mutilated puppies are not common but 24 hour vet hospitals are. I ran into the bathroom and grabbed towels to try and stop the bleeding. Bad idea! Instead of heroic first aid for puppies I ruined our hosts hand towels. \n The panic started to build and we desperately tried to think of our options. My next thought was to suffocate it. Turns out its really hard for someone not raised on a farm and unaccustomed to manually killing animals to suffocate a puppy armed with nothing more than a blood soaked hand towel. With that plan out the window we discussed trying to find a vet hospital. In Granada. At 1am on a Sunday. \n We wrapped the poor little dying puppy in another towel and headed towards the main road, both probably knowing we were shit out of luck. Every taxi we asked about an animal hospital looked at us like we were insane and shook their heads. \n In the end we had to find a grassy area to lay the puppy down on the ground to die. The whining had stopped and it was just labored wheezing at that point. Im convinced the murderer was the highly aggressive terrier mix I saw that morning. Bastard. \n Explaining to our host the next day why their towels were covered in blood was not fun. \n ", "features": ["phrases related to conflicts, injustices, and tragedies", "phrases related to legal matters and sports injuries", "phrases related to restaurants and food chains", "phrases related to direction and movement", "phrases related to physical locations and travel", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues"], "feature_ids": [25, 19, 20, 23, 68, 14], "scores": [0.98, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0, 0.98, 0.02]}

{"text": "(Ill start with a side note) This is the reason why some melee players shun from this game, the reason why they feel its off. As much as Melee itself is not exempt from such gimmicks (see: Shieks dthrow), such really good, almost free moves, are possessed by a good deal of the cast. Such things may be offset from other inherent character disadvantages, but that doesnt remove that theyre  there  and it doesnt make them feel any less cheap when they happen. \n Now , Im not saying theyre completely in the right with that, because Melee has a number of such really good moves, but what we did at the time was just learn to deal with it. We learned to DI every time Jiggs throws up, try to never get grabbed from Sheik, beware of Foxs shine etc. \n The fact is that those very moves  were  nerfed by the PMDT, which means they  are  actively interested in delivering a not OP feel to the characters. So where did it go wrong with the newcomers? \n Well, first theres to understand that the so-called meta is something really complicated to grasp, especially since its really matchup-based, and not character-based, and doubly so when theres  so many fucking characters . The PMDT couldnt and shouldnt be expected to know how a meta would evolve in any number of following months, as theyre only a handful of testers and were an entire community, with multiple tourneys each week. \n To further elaborate how fragile a meta is, keep in mind that a spot in the tier list depends for the most part on how you fare against the top of the food chain (ie.  how tourney-viable are you ). In Melee, many characters would actually be pretty good, if only someone couldnt just pull out a Shiek and chaingrab them to death, or pull out a Fox and waveshine them till offstage or usmash them with extreme prejudice, etc. \n To drive this point home, look at what happened to Jiggs. Next to no change from Melee (the biggest is a laggier upthrow, so no spacie massacre) and suddenly bottom tier. This shows that as much as a fighter can find even ground in many matchups (see: veterans), just a number of bad matchups can ruin your day, week, year, everything. \n Then theres the fact that sometimes a character may take its sweet time to come into the light and fully bloom, like it happened for Jiggs in Melee. This underdog factor ofc only complicates things, as they are events that greatly upset balance and meta when they happen. \n Then even discounting all that, for how much you test a fighter among your couple dozen testers, theres not much telling what will happen to his combat flow in a years time or more, not even backing ourselves with Melee foreknowledge. As much faster now as it was then, the fact is, meta development still takes time, and  any time is still too much time  if you want to see the results in the alpha stages, when the games not out yet. \n So, given that the less obvious ways for a character to be made good are out of the discussion when in dev phase, the only remaining possibility is, use the more obvious ways.  Think of a possible flow youd want this character to express and build the moves around it.  The alternative would be buffing and nerfing  without  a precise idea of where you want to lead this chars meta towards, but that easily looks even worse to me. This inevitably leads to unsubtle moves in terms of power and possible use. \n Its easy to then understand that in the first stages (read: first years) the meta may feel clunky, because it was basically spoonfed to us by the PMDT, and not shaped by organically exploring every nook and cranny of the fighterss possibilities, doubly so when one realizes theres like four times the matchups to explore and a goddamn lot more options available to the player, with basically all of the ATs from Melee AND Brawl COMBINED at the characters disposal, plus optionally MORE (like Squirtle). \n But, given that the characters can be edited at any time, this is what I actually feel is the best policy. It makes for a lot of viable characters from the get go (instead of the veterans dominating until by stroke of luck someone discovers how to actually play X decently) and when things get out of hand, you can always rein it in by careful application of the nerf stick. In time, each character may feel organic and realized in this manner. \n ", "features": ["phrases related to legal or formal statements", "phrases related to decision-making or judgment", "phrases related to technical specifications and features", "phrases related to politics and government", "phrases related to business and organizational positions", "phrases related to time and temporal concepts"], "feature_ids": [745, 30, 300, 335, 323, 305], "scores": [0.02, 0.08, 0.12, 0.04, 0.06, 0.18]}

But in parts of Europe and Asia, A445 is more common. \n The whole thing is moot. With the exception of electronic music, musicians are rarely going to be hitting the exact frequency with such consistency, and even then - having a tonal center for tuning is hugely different than having a tonal center in a piece. \n Even if A440 is what you  tune  an orchestra to (for example), you might hit between A435 - A445 or a range of frequencies for A during a performance, this is because we dont use  equal temperament  and the context of a note to others changes based upon harmonies. \n For example, in an orchestral setting most performers will likely hit the tonic of a major chord right on. But its most pleasing to our ears to have a 5th thats a bit flat (lower in frequency) and a 3rd thats  a bit sharp (higher in frequency). \n So if A is the tonic, youd get 440. \n But if its the 3rd (F major chord) youd get somewhere around 442 and if its the fifth (D major chord) youll be around 437. \n So, in an Orchestral setting, if the ensemble were sustaining a basic D major triad and the voices on the 5th were at 440, it would sound pitchy. \n Worrying about any one frequency in music is bizarre to say the least. \n *", "features": ["names of individuals"], "feature_ids": [2], "scores": [-0.99]}

{"text": "I bought my friends for $20 when he got a PS4 (the disc drive didnt work and peasants have very limited options for digital downloads, so it wasnt very helpful to them) just to play Demons Souls (which is on PSN). Of course the whole thing broke a couple months later, but I got everything I needed out of it (6 playthroughs). To any of you here that plan on doing the same: \n Demons Souls is a must if you are patient, I dont like it quite as much as Dark Souls but its almost as amazing \n RDR: Its overrated IMO, best part is hunting, exploration, and story, but there is A TON of mindless combat (theres a section where you sit on a gatling gun on a train for 30 minutes just mowing down randomly spawning dudes on horses, it doesnt even run out of ammo or overheat). If you are interested in the story though there are some youtube cuts of it that show the story parts (same goes for TLOU) \n Uncharted: It lasts less than 6 hours and even gets repetitive within those 6 hours, the enemy variety is pitiful and the combat isnt very deep to begin with. The story is about as good as Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (spoiler alert: its not good) but the action sequences are interesting if youre a micheal bay fan. \n Resistance 3: similar to Halo but more Red Dawn style, the guns are quite creative but the combat really isnt that great, typical shooter stuff. \n Killzone 3: Somewhere between COD and BF but sci-fi. Its fine, nothing in particular seems that great. \n TLOU: Fantastic story, decent gameplay. Id recommend watching a movie version on youtube, especially if youre not a fan of shooters. The gameplay is better than many other third person shooters but there ends up being far too much of it with little variety. It can be fairly tense on higher difficulties until you get near the end of the game and know the enemies far too well. \n Little BigPlanet: Think of it as a more polished but less deep version of Garrys Mod in a platforming setup. You can create levels and rules for them quite well, but it doesnt get anywhere near as complex as what you would find in Garrys Mod. Best suited for co-op. \n MGS4: This game is phenominal, the story is very interesting (despite some weird plot holes) and the characters are quite well written (for the most part). But the best part byfar is the gameplay*. This is a very deep stealth game, and there are lots of interesting missions and boss fights. You also get quite a bit of content in this game, completing the game for the first time should take well over 30 hours and its very replayable since many of the missions have tons of ways to go about them. \n *do not try and shoot your way through, its easy and boring. Im pretty sure combat doesnt even scale with the difficulty, it just affects how hard it is to sneak. \n TL:DR if youre not a big fan of shooters, MGS and Demons Souls are the only things you should really look into if youre getting a PS3. If you do like shooters, TLOU, RDR, and possibly Resistance/Killzone, may interest you. \n", "features": ["names of individuals"], "feature_ids": [2], "scores": [0.01]}

 idk.. maybe my SW40VE and its buffer spring are too much for this guy. \n then comes pants shitting time.\nhe pressed the barrel  against his chest , and with his thumb against the trigger guard continues to try to eject the round by forcing the slide.  its not working... and in my head im imagining how long it will take for another dozen cops to show up and beat my ass to death after this idiot shoots himself in the chest with my gun.  which.. has my prints all over it.. \n man i hope this guys dash cam is running or something... \n because even if the hollow point doesnt kill him from a point blank shot to the heart... im pretty sure he will fall backwards into traffic and get run the fuck over.   there is no chance ill have time to explain with a dead cop and my gun lying in the road. \n all im thinking is.. and i have no idea what else he said to me during the three or four attempts.. im going to either die by cop.. or after a long life in federal  pound me in the ass  prison. \n to my surprise, he doesnt discharge the round into himself, but instead hands me the pistol back with the round still chambered and asks  me  to eject it.  and then give it back. \n so i do.   i must have been obviously uncomfortable.. or pants shittingly scared.  im sure he took that as a lesson learned.. he inspected the .40 and then handed the mag, loose round, and gun back to me and then left to go run my tags. \n im stunned.. after all that, he gives it back to me..  turns his back .. and goes back to his car. \n i leave everything the way it is in my passenger seat.. im still terrified and re-loading seems like an awful idea.   the cop comes back a few moments later and tells me to be safer next time and to have a good day. \n be safer?  wtf? \n then i went home and smoked a bunch of weed. \n Murrica. \n ", "features": ["terms related to law enforcement and legal actions", "phrases related to legal matters and sports injuries", "phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "terms related to legal actions and disputes", "phrases related to laws, regulations, enforcement, and criminal activities", "phrases related to legal issues and news reporting", "terms related to legal matters and regulations", "phrases related to legal agreements or government actions"], "feature_ids": [9, 19, 14, 368, 556, 739, 658, 532], "scores": [0.85, 0.01, 0.23, 0.42, 0.67, 0.11, 0.31, 0.18]}

Web design itself changed as technologies evolved and enabled more print like experiences, with typography and layout skills even more important than ever on the web. \n 10s- Mobile is getting big, everything is all about ipads and phones, who needs designers anymore. Smart, talented and agile designers adapted. Startups now include design as a core part of their team, because they know that in the competitive app space, design is a differentiator.

As with almost all mature professions, schools will churn out way more people than jobs available, thats how they make money. Most of the graduates suck and wont get a job in design. It has been competitive for a long time. There have been cheap photographers, cheap designers, cheap logos etc forever, people have still been making careers in design.

{"text": "Just to be clear, I think these are the differences you mentioned (paraphrased); please correct me if Im wrong: \n School buses used to pick up multiple kids at once but now pick up kids at each house individually. \n Kids used to explore other neighborhoods or the woods until after dark but now play in their yards while supervised or on their iPads. \n \n Kids getting picked up at their doorstep does mean they lose out on any interactions with other children to/from/at a shared bus stop, but they should still have plenty of other interactions while on the bus or at school. I dont think this difference is enough to qualify kids these days as being any more or less sheltered/sad than they used to be. \n As for playing under supervision, there seems to have been a shift in societys attitude toward parental supervision in general. From what I can tell in books/movies/tv shows of the past, there used to be a much more cavalier approach toward watching over ones children. Nowadays, whether from fear-mongering (i.e., Stranger danger), new parenting techniques, or something else entirely, it seems parental supervision is encouraged and accepted. I dont think this necessarily means kids are sheltered or being held back, though some parents may end up taking it too far (e.g., helicopter parents). \n Kids can still explore and have outdoor adventures (even while supervised). Im sure there are still just as many (if not more) clubs/groups nowadays that promote outdoor activities for kids. Just because you dont see it in your neighborhood, doesnt mean its not happening elsewhere. \n And lastly, playing on tablets and other gadgets isnt necessarily a bad thing. Being familiar with how to operate certain devices and interfaces can be a valuable skillset. Hell, there are many jobs nowadays where youre expected/required to know how to use a computer. Who knows? The same could be said for tablets or other similar devices in the future. \n Additionally, there are plenty of learning tools and other applications for kids available these days.

You can work around all this by swapping mag tubes back and forth to make the barrels fit, but its kind of a PITA compared to remington. \n ", "features": ["phrases related to showcasing or demonstrating something", "phrases related to laws, regulations, enforcement, and criminal activities", "phrases related to legal matters and sports injuries", "phrases related to restaurants and food chains", "information related to the German language", "references to political inquiries or investigations", "phrases related to direction and movement"], "feature_ids": [13, 556, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], "scores": [0.22, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.22]}

{"text": "Mindfulness is a bit like meditation, but without the spiritual/religious aspect IME. \n In DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy) mindfulness is related to riding the wave. \n The idea is that  fighting off anxiety/negative emotions worsens them . The way to deal with these emotions is to  accept  them and feel them, even if it is scary or painful. \n Continuing with the wave metaphor, anxiety (for me) is like the waves at the beach. It comes regularly, and  most  of the time you can keep your head above water. \n Sometimes, a huge wave comes, and I can either try and run away, or I can try and fight it off, but  it will come no matter what I do . I am best served by  facing the wave , taking a deep breath, and believing that I will surface again. I might be disoriented, I might bash my face on the sand, I might have seaweed in my pants, but I  will  surface. \n A key part of mindfulness is  non-judgement . \n A judgmental thought might be I am so stupid for feeling anxious right now. \n A non judgmental thought might be I am really anxious right now and this makes me feel sad and angry that I cant control my feelings. \n In the first example, stupid is a word that does not give any real descriptive meaning. Stupid has many meanings, and the meaning that is mean (feeling sad and angry at lack of control) is not immediately apparent. \n Acknowledging that you feel stupid because you lack control over your emotions is much more helpful than beating yourself up over your perceived lack of intelligence. \n You can explore  why  not being in complete control distresses you*, why negative emotions cause such a disproportionate reaction, why these feelings cause extreme behaviors in attempts to escape the feelings. \n *me, in case you didnt realize \n Also; \n > Just telling myself nope, its not anxiety, youre fine isnt enough. \n This might not be helping because its not true. \n Yes, its not anxiety caused by a normal anxiety provoking event, but it  is  anxiety . \n You (and I) have a fear of fear. The very sensation of being anxious makes us anxious. \n Its a vicious cycle; you elevate your heart rate, your neurons tell you that you are experiencing a panic attack, your fear of a panic attack increases your anxiety, and this continues until you have a panic attack or you remove yourself from the situation. \n Bringing this back to exercise and anxiety, I would induce the anxiety-causing sensations of an elevated heart rate, sweat, shortness of breath, and I would practice  breathing  through it,  acknowledging  the fear,  accepting  the uncomfortable feelings, the nausea, the tremors. \n If I were in your shoes, I would start off by raising my heart rate for five minutes doing jumping jacks, and then pause and focus on my level of anxiety. \n I would ask myself, am I more anxious then I was when I started? By how much? Will it go away if I stop moving? \n I would rest, let my heart rate return to normal, then continue. \n I would then do some more jumping jacks/whatever to continue to keep my heart rate elevated, and then pause again to reflect on my anxiety. \n I would ask myself, is it just my heart rate that causes anxiety? Is it my shortness of breath? Is it sweat? \n I would try to unpack my thoughts and feelings about being anxious. \n Am I ashamed that I feel this way? Am I scared for my physical health? Am I scared of having a panic attack? Am I angry at my lack of control? Am I fearing for my physical safety? What would I tell my friend if they were telling me their feelings and thoughts about this? \n This last one is really important for me, because I treat myself much worse than I treat my friends. I beat myself up over my inability to implement what I know to be true. \n Something that I often say is that I  know  something to be true, but I dont  believe  it to be so. \n There is, for me, a break between the intellectual side of  knowing  that anxiety is caused by stuff in my brain, and  believing  that I am not a bad person for feeling anxious. \n Its much easier for me to tell my friends to treat themselves well than it is to treat myself well. Never mind that my friend and I have extremely similar experiences with ADHD, she has a legitimate learning disability, and Im a lazy bum. Shes deserving of accommodations, and Im taking advantage of the system, ect. \n With anxiety, other people are suffering from an illness, and I just cant get my shit together. \n Pretending that my problems are my friends, I can identify the kind and encouraging thoughts, and choose to acknowledge the incorrectness of thoughts like I am dumb and unworthy. \n ", "features": ["phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "phrases related to laws, regulations, enforcement, and criminal activities"], "feature_ids": [14, 556], "scores": [0.01, 0.0]}

{"text": ">Posted this in another thread. Cross-posting it here: \n Time on computers (at least when were talking about ban length) is measured in seconds. When someone gets a ban, they receive a ban with a corresponding number of seconds. 15 minutes is actually a 900 second ban, for instance. \n Now, when a computer handles numbers, it has a limited amount that it can store. Since computers count using zeros and ones, the maximum number a computer can hold is weird. If you have signed numbers (negative or positive) then the computer can hold between -2147483648 and 2147483647. If you dont have signs, it can hold numbers between 0 and 4294967295 without you telling it to store bigger numbers. \n One more thing: If you add one to the maximum number, it will wrap around to the minimum number because the ones and zeros used to measure it will overflow. Same happens backwards - if you subtract one from the minimum number, youll get the maximum number (if you want me to elaborate I can). \n So heres what happened. The method may not be 100% correct, but the result is the same: \n Programmer decided to use an unsigned (only positive) integer on time because youre not going to have a negative ban time. Maximum number: 4294967295\nProgrammer decides that the default ban time will be -1 seconds. This way, they can check at the end if there was any time added. If not, then they reset it to zero and move on.\nSome complicated bug in the program results in them forgetting to check for that -1, so the player gets banned for -1 seconds.\n \n Remember how we said that were only allowed to have numbers between 0 and 4294967295 because we have unsigned numbers? \n Remember how if you subtract 1 from the lowest number you get the maximum number? \n Those players got banned for 71582700 minutes.

{"text": "> How do you purge your mind of all of these limiting beliefs so you can achieve that level of success? \n The answer to that, though unpopular, is easy: dont let these beliefs turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you, as a minority, really do believe that you are inferior then youll trigger a nocebo effect which will make you inferior. I.E. your belief becomes a reality because you strongly believe in it. \n By deciding youre inferior youre automatically putting a subset of women on a pedestal; a Red Pill sin, rather a Manosphere sin right there. \n IMO I dont see why any RPer, regardless of race cant do well. I know that successful minorities and whites have one thing in common: they dont over think the race factor like other people do. \n Also heres the dangerous with minorities, something I feel whites are fortunate not to have: the victim card. The victim card can be played and used in any manner. Women and non-whites are accustomed to using this card whenever life doesnt hand them what they want.\nWhite males, when faced with this situation are  forced  to self improve because they have no gender/race card to play.

Whereas a chick rejects the minority: hell cry and scream while playing the race card (dont you say you dont see it; we see it every so often here)... Both parties are also willing to play the height card. \n The defence mechanism some men have is to pin failure to something they cannot control (height and race). \n What annoys me about some minority RPers is that theyll whine about race and shut down any member of the same race who has actually had success.

{"text": "No, not necessarily. They have totally different ideals and rationals but they come very close to resembling each other largely because of the need to industrialize their respective nations. Russia fought one World War, then a revolutionary Civil War, then had to rebuild and re-orientate their economy from agrarian to industrial on a massive scale. Germany lost the World War, and was heavily sanctioned and disarmed. Hitlers motives led to rapid rearmament. Italy was an agrarian country that chose to industrialize. \n Although the Italian Fascists rejected International Socialism, they did believe that Socialism was feasible as a system, but infeasible in Italy largely because Italy was more agrarian than industrial. Many of the first Fascists were ex-socialists, and many had studied Marx, of which they recognized that Marx never intended his theories to be applied to an agrarian country like Italy. The Fascists established a system that revolved around the nations interests, rather than the interests of liberty or the interests of a class. \n Lenin and Stalins rationale was totally different. The civil war showed them that the West was actively trying to destroy Bolshevik Russia, so rapid industrialization and rearmament was an absolute necessity. At the same time, Russia, like Italy, was largely agrarian and had to be reorientated to an industrial economy for socialism to work. When Lenin established the New Economic Policy, he stated it was essentially State Capitalism, but that it was necessary since, according to Marx, State Capitalism was the final stage of capitalism. \n International events that neither the Fascists nor the Communists had control of eventually led to very nationalistic characteristics in both the Fascists and Soviet. The world economic collapse forced Italy to move toward imperialism since the many western banks and governments were forced to stop giving loans to Italy. The Russian Civil War, and the Wests many attempts to undermine the USSR led Stalin to try to strengthen Russian Communism so it could better act as a vanguard of world revolution.

{"text": "I have been thinking about this off and on all week after my gynecologist appointment on Monday.  I moved recently, so this is only the second time Ive seen her, but she was questioning the fact that my medical information said I was diagnosed with PCOS.  I told her that the diagnosis was based on both blood work and ultrasound and that I have been on birth control for the past 9 years to help alleviate the symptoms/regulate hormones and asked why she doubted it.  Her response was basically unless you work really hard, you should be overweight and it infuriated me.  I was overweight and it took me a long  time and a lot of work to lose it. And even now, I still have to put in a lot of effort just to maintain. I always count calories/monitor my carbs through the week and I work out for ~1.5hrs 6 days a week.  Exercise is so ingrained in my life at this point that I just feel like shit when I dont, but I dont think I will ever get used to watching everything I eat.  It just flat out sucks. \n Advice for dealing with those rough days:  It happens to us all, and I know that I allow myself to be much too affected by those transient emotions, but exercising really helps keep my self-esteem intact.  If I had a really intense workout the day before, I always feel amazing.  Also, Ive realized that since I dont have a full-length mirror anymore, I can get on with my day without getting bogged down with counter-productive thoughts like oh, my legs look like little sausages. Ignoring what I look like isnt really what I mean, but paying attention to how I feel is much more important than fixating on what I look like (Ive learned my eyes can be very deceiving). \n Advice on managing: Have you been put on birth control or anything to help? I think it has been an important part of how Ive been dealing with it.  I believe that diet is the most important part of managing PCOS.  It has been a huge factor in helping me to not feel perpetually shitty and fatigued. As soon as I was diagnosed, my family pretty much changed the way we eat entirely.  Much more protein, much less carbs. Now, I am very strict about my diet and exercise, but I am also very particular about my physique.  This certainly isnt the case for everyone and you can probably get away with a little more wiggle room depending on your goals. In terms of exercise, there are all kinds of options.

{"text": "That build is ok, but it looks like you have yourself setup almost like a glass canon.  Just add book of thoth and its glassy.  With that said, you need to understand that chronos is not really the mage type like janus or even the kukulakan god.   Chronos is very much like, but not 100% like, Freya.  He does better when played like a hunter so to speak.  What I mean, is that he is better at being the AA type god, rather than the pure ability god. \n Being that he is better when played like an Auto-attacker, you need sustain, and lifesteal, isnt really enough to do the job.  If you get bursted too quick, you wont be able to ult away, and not being able to, means that your ult is now, useless and thus a waste of an ability.   However, you can build better to sustain much longer, and simply out do many of those mages who choose to be glassy. \n What I would suggest, is rush warlock sash.  In conquest, I personally get the usual shroud and the t1 item for chronos pendant, but after that, I then focus on getting warlock sash.   The main benefit from getting WS, si that you are building for a better end game.   Since your early game is between weak to okay but not strong enough to finish, you are better off being passive, conservative, and play it safe, and getting and stacking WS, is the way to go.  Let me explain. \n When you get warlock sash, you are build up health and power.  Power is good because power is good, but the health will allow you to continue to fight people longer without being bursted on and dying, which also means you have a larger gap between when you should ult, and when its too late to ult.   The extra health will seriously allow you to be able to ult away and thus live to continue to fight. \n Now, after getting WS, magi boots are great because they just are.  What I get after that, is Chronos pendant, THEN demonic grip.   The reason for this, is because I want to be able to pop my 2 more often, or my 3 and 1, more often, and that 25% CDR, will let me do it.  The mp5 it gives, is more than enough to last me throughout the match, so that means instead of getting the blue buff, I could go for the red or orange buff (I personally like the orange one).   Also, there is no need to get demonic grip too early in the match because your auto-attacks are not that strong yet, and you lack the power to make them do any good, so by having that be your 4th item, you can get your stacking item, your boots, your raw power and cdr item, and THEN get the attack speed item. \n So, after getting WS, magi boots, Chronos P., and demonic grip, I then go for the T.   Getting Rod of T as the 5th item, will be the icing for you because power + passive = prepare ur anus.   Now, you might think But what about a magic lifesteal item like bancroft? and its 100+ power?  Simple, because warlock sash gives you more power when max stacked.  (110 vs 100).  Sure you dont have lifesteal, but you now have 600 more health.   Your passive 1, heals you for 1.5% of your max per a second, for 7 seconds.  If you have 2000 health, then you will heal for 210 health after those 7 seconds.

A rat is a pig is a dog is a boy. They are all mammals.\n-Ingrid Newkirk, cofounder and current president of PeTA \n By that philosophy the killing of a human is no different than the killing of an animal.

But euthanizing  tens of thousands of animals is humane (a word that sounds suspiciously speciest if I may,) just because they MAY suffer, they MAY be left to the wild or with an abusive household, somehow is exempted in their minds.

{"text": "Not sure why youre being downvoted when nobody has really tried to properly address the question. \n Finland is, on many levels, extremely progressive and certainly does not have the issues with gender discrimination that some places too. However, it does have some  serious  legislative gaps with regard to rape, regardless of the legal difficulties around proving an offence has taken place. \n Finland subscribes to the degrees of rape school of thought when it comes to categorising sexual assaults. Sex crimes for which you can be charged are  coercive sexual contact, rape and aggravated rape. While the latter two do generally carry custodial sentences (roughly 4-10 years, I think the most extreme cases may be more but Im not sure), the most commonly used category is coercion into sexual intercourse, which sounds like what your friends attacker might have been adjudged to have done. \n The problem with this particular offence in law is that it includes circumstances that would lead many other countries to prosecute for rape rather than a lesser offence. While in the language, coercion into sexual intercourse is generally referred to as something like lesser degree rape, what is worrying is that it is defined by how much violence took place during the assault.  In theory, I imagine this is supposed to create a legal division between an assault on someone in a park in broad daylight and someone taken home after a party who was too intoxicated to give their consent (not going to debate the rights and wrongs of this here), but in practice this is not how the definition is applied. To quote the exact phrase from the law (translated): \n A person who by violence or threat coerces another into a sexual act other than that referred to in section 1 [aggravated rape] or into submission to such an act, thus essentially violating his or her right of sexual self-determination, shall be sentenced for coercion into a sexual act to a fine or to imprisonment for at most three years. \n Edit: This definition was written out of law in September this year (thanks /u/sensorih for pointing this out). The lesser definition in law is now called rape, specifically for those deemed unable to consent, but also usable in court for offences deemed not sever enough for the higher two categories. \n Im having trouble finding links (my Google-fu isnt so great in Finnish), but there have been cases in which only mild violence has been judged to have been used, leading to conditional sentencing and fines in lieu of prison. Because the guidelines in the law are highly open to interpretation, mild violence has included a woman being held up against a bathroom wall with a hand over her mouth. Mitigating circumstances which permit lesser sentences to be passed down have also included knowing the victim and having recently been made unemployed. \n Oh, and lets not not forget that it was only as recently as 1994 that rape within marriage was finally criminalised. Also, attitudes toward sexual crimes against women are a little worrying; in 2010, 74% of Finns polled said that the provocative behaviour of women had a role in the overall issue of violence against women[link]( This number seems ridiculously high for the Finns I know and love, but when Spain, Italy etc are returning numbers in the 30s then there must be something going on. \n ", "features": ["phrases related to laws, regulations, policies, and societal issues", "information related to governmental policies and international affairs", "terms related to legal matters and regulations", "mentions of specific locations or incidents involving them", "phrases related to legal matters and actions taken by individuals or groups", "phrases related to legal issues and news reporting"], "feature_ids": [14, 10, 658, 134, 154, 739], "scores": [0.98, 0.42, 0.92, 0.98, 0.82, 0.98]}

On behalf of the people using it, those hearing it in general, and those that its directed at specifically.

This isnt because it is, its just how the message ends up being received.

{"text": "Im gonna cut and paste my post from /r/cults. So sorry for the wall of text. \n From the time I was born to the death of my pastor when I was 14 my life was the church. An hour or more a day, 6 days a week, I heard about who God was. How awe inspiringly terrifying he was. How you could pray for vengeance and God would strike down your enemies. My pastor would share stories of people who had wronged him that had burned to death or died in accidents, taking credit for these things with pride, claiming it to be Gods wrath. I was in constant fear of an all knowing father who judged my every action and word. \n Our church was small, only 30 people or so, but it was as dedicated as you will ever find. Missing one day of church without a good excuse was considered a massive sin. Everyone was expected to take notes and study them on a daily basis. Weekdays were for the new testament and weekends were for the old testament. Which my pastor translated himself. Need I say more. \n I was homeschooled and didnt really have any outside perspective so I assumed thats how all Christians were. I assumed that fear, misery, and paranoia were part of the struggle in this life. The paranoia was the worst. We were armed and taught to shoot from a young age. Constantly told that the government was run by followers of satan and they would come for us some day. That if you allowed yourself to be taken in by the devil and turned your back on the church God would punish you more severely than any non believer. \n In the end it wasnt the paranoia, the fear, or the social isolation that made me start to question my situation, it was the suicide and murder of the pastors grandson. A close personal friend of mine. He moved to North Carolina when I was 11 and I was heartbroken. Losing one of the only friends I had was like losing a brother. I didnt know what to do. We didnt have the internet and I could only talk to him on the phone rarely so we lost contact after around a year. Only two years after we left our pastor came to the pulpit and informed us that my friend, who I considered family and who I missed so dearly, had murdered his brother and his sister and then killed himself. I would come to learn later that it was because of the physical and mental abuse he was receiving from his parents with the encouragement of the pastor. The man who I thought knew God better than anyone. \n Even after everything I had suffered it wasnt until the death of our pastor that we left the church. I didnt know how to handle myself. I went to school for the first time, was relentlessly bullied and on top of all that my mom and dad had an extremely messy divorce. I was alone and I couldnt even turn to the God I believed in because he terrified me too much. \n In the end its been 8 years and Im a normally adjusted guy. I have a lot of friends, a good job and even social skills. I will never fully recover mentally from everything I suffered and I still miss my best friend, as well as the community that the church provided, but Im so thankful that I left when I did.
